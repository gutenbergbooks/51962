    <h2>
      BIOGRAPHICAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edgar Wilson Nye was whole-souled, big-hearted and genial. Those who knew
      him lost sight of the humorist in the wholesome friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born August 25, 1850, in Shirley, Piscataquis County, Maine.
      Poverty of resources drove the family to St. Croix Valley, Wisconsin,
      where they hoped to be able to live under conditions less severe. After
      receiving a meager schooling, he entered a lawyer's office where most of
      his work consisted in sweeping the office and running errands. In his idle
      moments the lawyer's library was at his service. Of this crude and
      desultory reading he afterward wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could read the same passage today that I did yesterday and it would
      seem as fresh at the second reading as it did at the first. On the
      following day I could read it again and it would seem as new and
      mysterious as it did on the preceding day."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of twenty-five, he was teaching a district school in Polk
      County, Wisconsin, at thirty dollars a month. In 1877 he was justice of
      the peace in Laramie. Of that experience he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was really pathetic to see the poor little miserable booth where I sat
      and waited with numb fingers for business. But I did not see the pathos
      which clung to every cobweb and darkened the rattling casement. Possibly I
      did not know enough. I forgot to say the office was not a salaried one,
      but solely dependent upon fees. So while I was called Judge Nye and
      frequently mentioned in the papers with consideration, I was out of coal
      half the time, and once could not mail my letters for three weeks because
      I did not have the necessary postage."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote some letters to the Cheyenne <i>Sun</i> and soon made such a
      reputation for himself that he was able to obtain a position on the
      Laramie <i>Sentinel</i>. Of this experience he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The salary was small, but the latitude was great, and I was permitted to
      write anything that I thought would please the people, whether it was news
      or not. By and by I had won every heart by my patient poverty and my
      delightful parsimony with regards to facts. With a hectic imagination and
      an order on a restaurant which advertised in the paper I scarcely cared
      through the livelong day whether school kept or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the proprietor of the <i>Sentinel</i> he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know whether he got into the penitentiary or the Greenback party.
      At any rate he was the wickedest man in Wyoming. Still, he was
      warm-hearted and generous to a fault. He was more generous to a fault than
      to anything else&mdash;more especially his own faults. He gave me twelve
      dollars a week to edit the paper&mdash;local, telegraph, selections,
      religious, sporting, political, fashions, and obituary. He said twelve
      dollars was too much, but if I would jerk the press occasionally and take
      care of his children he would try to stand it. You can't mix politics and
      measles. I saw that I would have to draw the line at measles. So one day I
      drew my princely salary and quit, having acquired a style of fearless and
      independent journalism which I still retain. I can write up things that
      never occurred with a masterly and graphic hand. Then, if they occur, I am
      grateful; if not, I bow to the inevitable and smother my chagrin."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of a wrangle in politics he was appointed postmaster of his
      town and his letter of acceptance, addressed to the Postmaster-General at
      Washington, was the first of his writings to attract national attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that, in his opinion, his being selected for the office was a
      triumph of eternal right over error and wrong. "It is one of the epochs, I
      may say, in the nation's onward march toward political purity and
      perfection," he wrote. "I don't know when I have noticed any stride in the
      affairs of state which has so thoroughly impressed me with its wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after he became postmaster he started the <i>Boomerang</i>. The
      first office of the paper was over a livery stable and Nye put up a sign
      instructing callers to "twist the tail of the gray mule and take the
      elevator."
    </p>
    <p>
      He at once became famous and was soon brought to New York, at a salary
      that seemed fabulous to him. His place among the humorists of the world
      was thenceforth assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died February 22,1896, at his home in North Carolina, surrounded by his
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Whitcomb Riley, the Hoosier poet, was for many years a close
      personal friend of the dead humorist. When informed of Nye's death, he
      said: "Especially favored, as for years I have been, with close personal
      acquaintance and association with Mr. Nye, his going away fills me with
      selfishness of grief that finds a mute rebuke in my every memory of him.
      He was unselfish wholly, and I am broken-hearted, recalling the always
      patient strength and gentleness of this true man, the unfailing hope and
      cheer and faith of his child-heart, his noble and heroic life, and pure
      devotion to his home his deep affections, constant dreams, plans and
      realizations. I cannot doubt but that somehow, somewhere, he continues
      cheerily on in the unbroken exercise of these same capacities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Riley recently wrote the following sonnet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      O William, in thy blithe companionship
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      What liberty is mine&mdash;what sweet release
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From clamourous strife, and yet, what boisterous peace!
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Ho! ho! It is thy fancy's finger tip
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That dints the dimple now, and kinks the lip

    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">

    <p>
      Washington, D. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along toward morning, 1887.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cashier World Office</i>, New York.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y DEAR SIR: You
      will doubtless be surprised to hear from me so soon, as I did not promise
      when I left New York that I would write you at all while here. But now I
      take pen in hand to say that the Senate and House of Representatives are
      having a good deal of fun with me, and hope you are enjoying the same
      great blessing. You will wonder at first why I send in my expense account
      before I send in anything for the paper, but I will explain that to you
      when I get back. At first I thought I would not bother with the expense
      account till I got to your office, but I can now see that it is going to
      worry me to get there unless I hear from you favorably by return mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came here I fell into the mad whirl of society, and attracted a
      good deal of attention by my cultivated ways and Jeffersonian method of
      sleeping with a different member of Congress every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not written anything for publication yet, but I am getting material
      together that will make people throughout our broad land open their eyes
      in astonishment. I shall deal fairly and openly with these great national
      questions, and frankly hew to the line, let the chips fall where they may,
      as I heard a man say to-day on the floor of the house&mdash;the Willard
      House, I mean. But I believe in handling great political matters without
      gloves, as you will remember, if you have watched my course as justice of
      the peace and litterateur. Candor is my leading characteristic, and if you
      will pardon me for saying so in the first letter you ever received from me
      I believe there is nothing about my whole character which seems to
      challenge my admiration for myself any more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congressmen and their wives are daily landing at the great national Castle
      Garden and looking wildly around for the place where they are told they
      will get their mileage. On every hand all is hurry and excitement. Bills
      are being introduced, acquaintances renewed, and punch bowls are beginning
      to wear a preoccupied air.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been mingling with society ever since I came here, and that is one
      reason I have written very little for publication, and did not send what I
      did write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday afternoon my money gave out at 3:20, and since that my mind has
      been clearer and society has made fewer demands on me. At first I thought
      I would obtain employment at the Treasury Department as exchange editor in
      the greenback room. Then I remembered that I would get very faint before I
      could go through a competitive examination, and, in the meantime, I might
      lose social caste by wearing my person on the outside of my clothes. So I
      have resolved to write you a chatty letter about Washington, assuring you
      that I am well, and asking you kindly to consider the enclosed tabulated
      bill of expenses, as I need the money to buy Christmas presents and get
      home with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poker is one of the curses of national legislation. I have several times
      heard prominent foreigners say, in their own language&mdash;think ing, no
      doubt, that I could not understand them&mdash;that the members of the
      American Congress did not betray any emotion on their countenances. One
      foreigner from Liverpool, who thought I could not understand his language,
      said that our congressmen had a way of looking as though they did not know
      very much. When he afterwards played poker with those same men he saw that
      the look was acquired. One man told me that his vacant look had been as
      good as $50,000 to him, whether he stood pat or drew to an ostensible
      flush while really holding four bullets.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far I have not been over to the Capitol, preferring to have Congress
      kind of percolate into my room, two or three at a time; but unless you can
      honor the inclosed way-bill I shall be forced to go over to the House
      to-morrow and write something for the paper. Since I have been writing
      this I have been led to inquire whether it would be advisable for me to
      remain here through the entire session or not. It will be unusually long,
      lasting perhaps clear into July, and I find that the stenographers as a
      general thing get a pretty accurate and spicey account of the proceedings,
      much more so than I can, and as you will see by inclosed statement it is
      going to cost more to keep me here than I figured on.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea was that board and lodgings would be the main items of expense,
      but I struck a low-priced place, where, by clubbing together with some
      plain gentlemen from a distance who have been waiting here three years for
      political recognition, and who do not feel like surrounding themselves
      with a hotel, we get a plain room with six beds in it. The room overlooks,
      the District of Columbia, and the first man in has the choice of beds,
      with the privilege of inviting friends to a limited number. We lunch
      plainly in the lower part of the building in a standing position without
      restraint or finger-bowls. So board is not the principal item of expense,
      though of course I do not wish to put up at a place where I will be a
      disgrace to the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish that you would, when you send my check, write me frankly whether
      you think I had better remain here during the entire season or not. I like
      the place first rate, but my duties keep me up nights to a late hour, and
      I cannot sleep during the day, because my roommates annoy me by doing
      their washing and ironing over an oil stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know by what several friends have said to me that Congress would like to
      have me stay here all winter, but I want to do what is best for the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Mr. Cleveland briefly last evening at his home, but he was
      surrounded by a crowd of fawning sycophants, so I did not get a chance to
      speak to him as I would like to, and don't know as he would have advanced
      the amount to me anyway. He is very firm and stubborn, I judged, and would
      yield very little indeed, especially to
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Nye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following bill looks large in the aggregate, but when you come to
      examine each item by itself there is really nothing startling about it,
      and when you remember that I have been here now four days and that this is
      the first bill I have sent in to the office during that time, I know you
      will not consider it out of the way, especially as you are interested in
      seeing me make a good paper of the <i>World</i>, no matter what the
      expense is.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are having good open winter weather and stock is looking well so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear you will regard the item for embalming as exorbitant, and it is so,
      but I was compelled to pay that price, as the man had to be shipped a long
      distance, and I did not want to shock his friends too much when he met
      them at the depot.

      I will probably remain here until I hear from you favorably. I have met
      several members of Congress for whom I have voted at various times off and
      on, but they were cold and haughty in their intercourse with me. I have
      been invited to sit on the floor of the House until I get some other place
      to stay, but I hate to ride a free horse to death.

    <h2>
      A PATENT ORATORICAL STEAM ORGANETTE FOR RAILWAY STUMPING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> AM now preparing
      for general use and desire to call the attention of numerous readers to
      what I have nominated the Campaigner's Companion, for use during or
      preceding a hot political campaign. Eureka is a very tame expression for
      this unique little contrivance, as it is good for any speaker and on
      behalf of any party, I care not of what political belief the orator may
      be. It is intended for immediate use, like a box of dry plates on an
      amateur photographic tour, only that it is more on the principle of the
      Organette, with from 500 to 5,000 tunes packed with it ready for use.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is intended to be worked easily on the rear platform of a special car,
      and absolutely prevents repetition or the wrong application of local gags.
      Every political speaker of any importance has suffered more or less from
      what may be called the misplaced gag, such as localizing the grave of a
      well-known member of Congress in the wrong county or swelling up with
      pardonable pride over large soap works in a rival town fifty miles away
      from the one where they really are. All these things weaken the political
      possibilities of great men and bring contumely upon the party they
      represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea is to arrange a sort of Organette on the rear platform of the car,
      to be operated by steam conducted from the engine by means of pipes, the
      contrivance to be entirely out of sight, under a neat little spread made
      of the American flag. Behind this an eminent man may stand with his hand
      socked into the breast of his frock coat nearly up to the elbow, and while
      his bosom swells with pardonable pride the engineer turns on steam.
      Previously the private secretary has inserted a speech prepared on punched
      paper, furnished by me and bearing on that special town and showing a
      degree of familiarity with that neighborhood which would win the entire
      adult population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind this machine the eminent speaker weaves to and fro, simply making
      the gestures and shutting off the steam with his foot whenever there is a
      manifest desire on the part of the audience to applaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am having over five hundred good one-night towns prepared in this way
      and, if it would not take up too much of your space, I would like to give
      here one speech, illustrating my idea and showing the plan in brief,
      though with each machine I furnish a little book called "Every Man his Own
      Demosthenes." This book tells exactly how to work the Campaigner's
      Companion and makes it almost a pleasure to aspire to office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen as an illustration a speech that I have had prepared for
      Asheville, N. C., but all the others are equally applicable and apropos.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Note: See that all bearing's are well oiled before you start, especially
      political bearings. See that the crank is just tight enough, without being
      too tight, and also that the journals do not get hot.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fellow-Citizens of Asheville and Buncombe County and Brother Tarheels
      from Away Back</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were a faithful Mohammedan and believed that I could never enter
      heaven but once, I would look upon Buncombe County and despair ever
      afterwards. (Four minutes for applause to die away.) Asheville is 2,339
      feet above tide-water. She is the hotbed of the invalid and the home of
      the physical wreck who cannot live elsewhere, but who comes here and lives
      till he gets plum sick of it. Your mountain breezes and your fried chicken
      bear strength and healing in their wings. (Hold valve open two minutes and
      a half to give laughter full scope.) Your altitude and your butter are
      both high, and the man who cannot get all the fresh air he wants on your
      mountains will do well to rent one of your cottages and allow the wind to
      meander through his whiskers. Asheville is a beautiful spot, where a peri
      could put in a highly enjoyable summer, picknicking along the Swananea
      through the day and conversing with Plum Levy at his blood-curdling barber
      shop in the gloaming. Nothing can possibly be thrillinger than to hear
      Plum tell of the hair-breadth escapes his customers have had in his cozy
      little shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annual rainfall here is 40.2 inches, while smoking tobacco and horned
      cattle both do well. Ten miles away stretches Alexander's. You are only
      thirty-five miles from Buck Forest. Pisgah Mountain is only twenty miles
      from here, and Tahkeeastee Farm is only a mile away, with its name
      extending on beyond as far as the eye can reach. The French Broad River
      bathes your feet on the right and the sun-kissed Swananoa, with its
      beautiful borders of rhododendrons, sloshes up against you on the other
      side. Mount Mitchell, with an altitude of 6,711 feet and an annual
      rain-fall of 53.8 inches, is but twenty miles distant, while Lower Hominy
      is near, and Hell's Half Acre, Sandy Mush and Blue Ruin are within your
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun never lit up a cuter little town than Asheville. Nature just
      seemed to wear herself out on Buncombe County and then she took what she
      had left over to make the rest of the country. Your air is full of vigor.
      Your farms get up and hump themselves in the middle or on one side, so
      that you have to wear a pair of telegraph-pole climbers when you dig your
      potatoes. Here you will see the japonica, the jonquil and the jaundice
      growing side by side in the spring, and at the cheese-foundry you can hear
      the skipper calling to his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the home of General Tom Clingman, who first originated the idea of
      using tobacco externally for burns, scalds, ringworm, spavin, pneumonia,
      Bright's disease, poll evil, pip, garget, heartburn, earache and financial
      stringency Here Randolph &amp; Hunt can do your job printing for you, and
      the <i>Citizen</i> and the <i>Advance</i> will give you the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are on a good line of railroad and I like your air very much, aside
      from the air just played by your home band. Certainly you have here the
      makings of a great city. You have pure air enough here for a city four
      times your present size, and although I have seen most all the
      Switzerlands of America, I think that this is in every way preferable.
      People who are in search of a Switzerland of America that can be relied
      upon will do well to try your town.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having touched upon everything of national importance that I can
      think of, I will close by telling you a little anecdote which will,
      perhaps, illustrate my position better than I could do it in any other
      way. (Here I insert a humorous anecdote which has no special bearing on
      the political situation and during the ensuing laughter the train pulls
      out.)

    <h2>
      VERITAS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y NAME is Veritas.
      I write for the papers. I am quite an old man and have written my kindly
      words of advice to the press for many years. I am the friend of the public
      and the guiding star of the American newspaper. I point out the proper
      course for a newly-elected member of Congress and show the thoughtless
      editor the wants of the people. I write on the subject of political
      economy; also on both sides of the paper. Sometimes I write on both sides
      of the question. When I do so I write over the name of Tax-Payer, but my
      real name is Veritas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the man who first suggested the culvert at the Jim street crossing,
      so that the water would run off toward the pound after a rain. With my
      ready pen&mdash;ready, and trenchant also, as I may say&mdash;I have, in
      my poor, weak way, suggested a great many things which might otherwise
      have remained for many years unsuggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the man who annually calls for a celebration of the Fourth of July in
      our little town, and asks for some young elocutionist to be selected by
      the committee, whose duty it shall be to read the Declaration of
      Independence in a shrill voice to those who yearn to be thrilled through
      and through with patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I not speak through the columns of the press in clarion tones for a
      proper observance of our nation's great natal day in large gothic extended
      caps, the nation's starry banner would remain furled and the greased pig
      would continue to crouch in his lair. With the aid of my genial co-workers
      Tax-Payer, Old Settler, Old Subscriber, Constant Reader, U. L. See, Fair
      Play, and Mr. Pro Bono Publico, I have made the world a far more desirable
      place in which to live than it would otherwise have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      My co-laborer, Mr. Tax-Payer, is an old contributor to the paper, but he
      is not really a taxpayer. He uses this signature in order to conceal his
      identity, just as I use the name Veritas. We have a great deal of fun over
      this at our regular annual reunions, where we talk about all our affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Settler is a young tenderfoot who came here last spring and tried to
      obtain a livelihood by selling an indestructible lamp-chimney. He did well
      for several weeks by going to the different residences and throwing one of
      his glass chimneys on the floor with considerable force to show that it
      would not break. He did a good business till one day he made a mistake.
      Instead of getting hold of his exhibition chimney, he picked out one of
      the stock and busted it beyond recognition. Since that he has been writing
      articles in violet ink relative to old times and publishing them over the
      signature of Old Settler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Subscriber is a friend of mine who reads his paper at the hotels while
      waiting for a gratuitous drink. Fair Play is a retired monte man, and Pro
      Bono Publico is our genial and urbane undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a very prolific writer, but all my work is not printed. A venal and
      corrupt press at times hesitates about giving currency to such fearless,
      earnest truths as I make use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also the man who says brave things in the columns of the papers when
      the editor himself does not dare to say them because he is afraid he will
      be killed. But what recks Veritas the bold and free? Does he flinch or
      quail? Not a flinch; not a quail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boldly he flings aside his base fears, and with bitter vituperation he
      assails those he dislikes, and attacks with resounding blows his own
      personal enemies, fearlessly signing his name, Veritas, to the article, so
      that those who yearn to kill him may know just who he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the world do without Veritas? In the hands of a horde of
      journalists who have nothing to do but attend to their business, left with
      no anonymous friend to whom they can fly when momentous occasions arise,
      when the sound advice and better judgment of an outside friend is needed,
      their condition would indeed be a pitiable one. But he will never desert
      us. He is ever at hand, prompt to say, over his nom de plume, what he
      might hesitate to say over his own name, for fear that he might go home
      with a battle of Gettysburg under each eye and a nose like a volcanic
      eruption. He cheerfully attacks everything and everybody, and then goes
      away till the fight, the funeral, and the libel suit are over. Then he
      returns and assails the grim monster Wrong. He proposes improvements, and
      the following week a bitter reply comes from Tax-Payer. Pro Bono Publico,
      the retired three-card-monteist, says: "Let us have the proposed
      improvement, regardless of cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the cynical U. L. See (who is really the janitor at the blind asylum)
      grumbles about useless expense, and finally draws out from the teeming
      brain of Constant Reader a long, flabby essay, written on red-ruled
      leaves, cut out of an old meat-market ledger, written economically on both
      sides with light blue ink made of bluing and cold tea. This essay
      introduces, under the most trying circumstances, such crude yet original
      literary gems as:
    </p>
    <p>
      Wad some power the giftie gie us, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also says:
    </p>
    <p>
      The wee sma' hours ayant the twal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And farther on:
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathes there a man with soul so deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who never to himself hath said, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      His essay is not so much the vehicle of thought as it is the accommodation
      train for fragments of his old school declamations to ride on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Veritas we owe much. I say this because I know what I am talking
      about, for am I not old Veritas himself? Haven't I been writing things for
      the papers ever since papers were published? Am I not the man who for
      years has been a stranger to fear? Have I not again and again called the
      congressman, the capitalist, the clergyman, the voter and the
      philanthropist everything I could lay my tongue to, and then fought
      mosquitoes in the deep recesses of the swamp while the editor remained at
      the office and took the credit for writing what I had given him for
      nothing? Has not many a paper built up a name and a libel suit upon what I
      have written, and yet I am almost unknown? When people ask, Who is
      Veritas? and where does he live? no one seems to know. He is up seven
      flights of stairs, in a hot room that smells of old clothes and neglected
      thoughts. Far from the "madding crowd," as Constant Reader has so truly
      said, I sit alone, with no personal property but an overworked costume, a
      strong love for truth, and a shawl-strap full of suggestions to the
      overestimated man who edits the paper..
    </p>
    <p>
      So I battle on, with only the meager and flea-bitten reward of seeing my
      name in print "anon," as Constant Reader would say. All I have to fork
      over to posterity is my good name, which I beg leave to sign here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veritas.

      THE DRUG BUSINESS IN KANSAS
    </h2>

      Hudson, Wis.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. BILL NYE.&mdash;Dear
      Sir: I hope you will pardon me for addressing you on a matter of pure
      business, but I have heard that you are not averse to going out of your
      way to do a favor now and then to those who are sincere and appreciative.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned from a friend that you have been around all over the west,
      and so I have taken the liberty of writing you to ask what you think would
      be the chance of success for a young man if he were to go to Kansas to
      enter the drug business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a practical young druggist 23 years of age, and have some money&mdash;a
      few hundred dollars&mdash;with which to go into business. Would you advise
      Kansas or Colorado as a good part of the west for that business?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also written some for the press, but with little success. I inclose
      you a few slips cut from the papers in which these articles originally
      appeared. I send stamp for reply and hope you will answer me, even though
      your time may be taken up pretty well by other matters. Respectfully
      yours.

    <p>
      Lock-Box 604.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudson, Wis., Oct. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Adolph Jaynes, Lock-box 604.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR: Your favor of late date is at hand, and I take pleasure in
      writing this dictated letter to you, using the columns of the Chicago
      Daily News as a delicate way of teaching you. I will take the liberty of
      replying to your last question first, if you pardon me, and I say that you
      would do better, no doubt at once, in a financial way, to go on with your
      drug business than to monkey with literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, your style of composition is like the present style of
      dress among men. It is absolutely correct, and therefore it is absolutely
      like that of nine men out of every ten we meet. Your style of writing has
      a mustache on it, wears a three-button cutaway of some Scotch mixture,
      carries a cane, and wears a straight, stand-up collar and scarf. It is so
      correct and so exactly in conformity with the prevailing style of
      composition, and your thoughts are expressed so thoroughly like other
      people's methods of dressing up their sentences and sand-papering the soul
      out of what they say, that I honestly think you would succeed better by
      trying to subsist upon the quick sales and small profits which the drug
      trade insures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let us consider the question of location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously, you ought to look over the ground yourself, but as you have
      asked me to give you my best judgment on the question of preference as
      between Kansas and Colorado I will say without hesitation that, if you
      mean by the drug business the sale of sure-enough drugs, medicines,
      paints, oils, glass, putty, toilet articles, and prescriptions carefully
      compounded, I would <i>not</i> go to Kansas at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to go to a flourishing country and put out a big
      basswood mortar in front of your shop in order to sell the tincture of
      damnation throughout bleeding Kansas, now is your golden opportunity. Now
      is the accepted time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is the great, big, burning desire of your heart to go into a town of
      2,000 people and open the thirteenth drug store in order that you may
      stand behind a tall black-walnut prescription case day in and day out,
      with a graduate in one hand and a Babcock fire-extinguisher in the other,
      filling orders for whisky made of stump-water and the juice of future
      punishment, you will do well to go to Kansas. It is a temperance state,
      and no saloons are allowed there. All is quiet and orderly, and the drug
      business is a great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can run a dummy drug store there with two dozen dreary old glass
      bottles on the shelves, punctuated by the hand of time and the Kansas fly
      of the period, and with a prohibitory law at your back and a tall, red
      barrel in the back room filled with a mixture that will burn great holes
      into nature's heart and make the cemetery blossom as the rose, and in a
      few years you can sell enough of this justly celebrated preparation for
      household, scientific, and experimental purposes only to fill your flabby
      pockets with wealth and paint the pure air of Kansas a bright and
      inflammatory red.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you sincerely and earnestly yearn for a field where you may go forth
      and garner an honest harvest from the legitimate effort of an upright soda
      fountain and free and open sale of slippery elm in its unadulterated
      condition, I would go to some state where I would not have to enter into
      competition with a style of pharmacy that has the unholy instincts and
      ambitions of a blind pig. I would not go into the field where red-eyed
      ruin simply waited for a prescription blank, not necessarily for
      publication, but simply as a guaranty of good faith, in order that it may
      bound forth from behind the prescription case and populate the poorhouses
      and the paupers' nettle-grown addition to the silent city of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great question of how best to down the demon rum is before the
      American people, and it will not be put aside until it is settled; but
      while this is being attended to, Mr. Jaynes, I would start a drug store
      farther away from the center of conflict and go on joyously, sacrificing
      expensive tinctures, compounds, and sirups at bed-rock prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go on, Mr. Jaynes, dealing out to the yearning, panting public, drugs,
      paints, oils, glass putty, varnish, patent medicines, and prescriptions
      carefully compounded, with none to molest or make afraid, but shun, oh
      shun the wild-eyed pharmacopoeia that contains naught but the festering
      fluid so popular in Kansas, a compound that holds crime in solution and
      ruin in bulk, that shrivels up a man's gastric economy, and sears great
      ragged holes into his immortal soul. Take this advice home to your heart
      and you will ever command the hearty co-operation of "yours for health,"
      as the late Lydia E. Pinkham so succinctly said.

      THE PERILS OF IDENTIFICATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chicago, Feb. 20,1888.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>INANCIAL circles
      here have been a good deal interested in the discovery of a cipher which
      has been recently adopted by a depositor and which began to attract the
      attention at first of a gentleman employed in the Clearing House. He was
      telling me about it and showing me the vouchers or duplicates of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was several months ago that he first noticed on the back of a check
      passing through the Clearing-House the following cipher, written in a
      symmetrical Gothic hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Sir: Herewith find payment for last month's butter. It was hardly
      up to the average. Why do you blonde your butter? Your butter last month
      tried to assume an effeminate air, which certainly was not consistent with
      its vigor. Is it not possible that this butter is the brother to what we
      had the month previous, and that it was exchanged for its sister by
      mistake? We have generally liked your butter very much, but we will have
      to deal elsewhere if you are going to encourage it in wearing a full
      beard. Yours truly, W.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Moneyed men all over Chicago and financial cryptogrammers came to read the
      curious thing and to try and work out its bearing on trade. Everybody took
      a look at it, and went away defeated. Even the men who were engaged in
      trying to figure out the identity of the Snell murderer took a day off and
      tried their Waterbury thinkers on this problem. In the midst of it all
      another check passed through the Clearing House with this cipher, in the
      same hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir: Your bill for the past month is too much. You forget the eggs
      returned at the end of second week, for which you were to give me credit.
      The cook broke one of them by mistake, and then threw up the portfolio of
      pie-founder in our once joyous home. I will not dock you for loss of cook,
      but I cannot allow you for the eggs. How you succeed in dodging quarantine
      with eggs like that is a mystery to yours truly, W.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Great excitement followed the discovery of this indorsement on a check for
      $32.87. Everybody who knew anything about-ciphering was called in to
      consider it. A young man from a high school near here, who made a
      specialty of mathematics and pimples, and who could readily tell how long
      a shadow a nine pound groundhog would cast at 2 o'clock and 37 minutes
      p.m., on groundhog day, if sunny, at the town of Fungus, Dak., provided
      latitude and longitude and an irregular mass of red chalk be given to him,
      was secured to jerk a few logarithms in the interests of trade. He came
      and tried it for a few days, covered the interior of the Exposition
      Building with figures and then went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pinkerton detectives laid aside their literary work on the great train
      book, entitled "The Jerk-water Bank Bobbery and Other Choice Crimes," by
      the author of "How I Traced a Lame Man Through Michigan, and Other
      Felonies." They grappled with the cipher, and several of them leaned up
      against something and thought for a long time, but they could make neither
      head nor tail to it. Ignatius Donnelly took a powerful dose of kumiss, and
      under its maddening influence sought to solve the great problem which
      threatened to engulf the nation's surplus. All was in vain. Cowed and
      defeated, the able conservators of coin, who require a man to be
      identified before he can draw on his overshoes at sight, had to
      acknowledge if this thing continued it threatened the destruction of the
      entire national fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time I was calling at the First National Bank of Chicago, the
      greatest bank, if I am not mistaken, in America. I saw the bonds securing
      its issue of national currency the other day in Washington, and I am quite
      sure the custodian told me it was the greatest of any bank in the Union.
      Anyway, it was sufficient, so that I felt like doing my banking business
      there whenever it became handy to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked for a certificate of deposit for $2,000, and had the money to pay
      for it, but I had to be identified. "Why," I said to the receiving teller,
      "surely you don't require a man to be identified when he deposits money,
      do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, isn't that a new twist on the crippled industries of this country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that's our rule. Hurry up, please, and don't keep men waiting who
      have money and know how to do business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't want to obstruct business, of course, but suppose, for
      instance, I get myself identified by a man I know and a man you know and a
      man who can leave his business and come here for the delirious joy of
      identifying me, and you admit that I am the man I claim to be,
      corresponding as to description, age, sex, etc., with the man I advertise
      myself to be, how would it be about your ability to identify yourself as
      the man you claim to be? I go all over Chicago, visiting all the large
      pork-packing houses in search of a man I know, and who is intimate with
      literary people like me, and finally we will say, I find one who knows me
      and who knows you, and whom you know, and who can leave his leaf lard long
      enough to come here and identify me all right. Can you identify yourself
      in such a way that when I put in my $2,000 you will not loan it upon
      insufficient security, as they did in Cincinnati the other day, as soon as
      I go out of town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we don't care especially whether you trade here or not, so that you
      hurry up and let other people have a chance. Where you make a mistake is
      in trying to rehearse a piece here instead of going out to Lincoln Park or
      somewhere in a quiet part of the city. Our rules are that a man who makes
      a deposit here must be identified."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Do you know Queen Victoria?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sir; I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, there is no use in disturbing her. Do you know any other of
      the crowned heads?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, do you know President Cleveland, or any of the Cabinet, or
      the Senate or members of the House?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, you see. I move in one set and you in another. What
      respectable people do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have to ask you to stand aside, I guess, and give that string of
      people a chance. You have no right to take up my time in this way. The
      rules of the bank are inflexible. We must know who you are, even before we
      accept your deposit."
    </p>
    <p>
      I then drew from my pocket a copy of the Sunday <i>World</i> which
      contained a voluptuous picture of myself. Removing my hat and making a
      court salaam by letting out four additional joints in my lithe and
      versatile limbs, I asked if any further identification would be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily closing the door to the vault and jerking the combination, he said
      that would be satisfactory. I was then permitted to deposit in the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why I should always be regarded with suspicion wherever I
      go. I do not present the appearance of a man who is steeped in crime, and
      yet when I put my trivial, little, two-gallon valise on the seat of a
      depot waiting-room a big man with a red mustache comes to me and hisses
      through his clenched teeth: "Take yer baggage off the seat!" It is so
      everywhere. I apologize for disturbing a ticket agent long enough to sell
      me a ticket, and he tries to jump through a little brass wicket and
      throttle me. Other men come in and say: "Give me a ticket for Bandoline,
      O., and be dam sudden about it, too," and they get their ticket and go
      aboard the car and get the best seat, while I am begging for the
      opportunity to buy a seat at full rates and then ride in the wood box. I
      believe that common courtesy and decency in America needs protection. Go
      into an hotel or a hotel, whichever suits the eyether and nyether reader
      of these lines, and the commercial man who travels for a big
      sausage-casing house in New York has the bridal chamber, while the meek
      and lowly minister of the Gospel gets a wall-pocket room with a cot, a
      slippery-elm towel, a cake of cast-iron soap, a disconnected bell, a view
      of the laundry, a tin roof and $4 a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I digress. I was speaking of the bank check cipher. At the First
      National Bank I was shown another of these remarkable indorsements. It
      read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Sir: This will be your pay for chickens and other fowls received
      up to the first of the present month. Time is working' wondrous changes in
      your chickens. They are not such chickens as we used to get of you before
      the war. They may be the same chickens, but oh! how changed by the lapse
      of time! How much more indestructible! How they have learned since then to
      defy the encroaching tooth of remorseless ages, or any other man! Why do
      you not have them tender like your squashes! I found a blue poker chip in
      your butter this week. What shall I credit myself for it? If you would try
      to work your butter more and your customers less it would be highly
      appreciated, especially by, yours truly, W.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the signature on the check itself, I found it to be that of
      Mrs. James Wexford, of this city. Knowing Mr. Wexford, a wealthy and
      influential publisher here, I asked him today if he knew anything about
      this matter. He said that all he knew about it was that his wife had a
      separate bank account, and had asked him several months ago what was the
      use of all the blank space on the back of a check, and why it couldn't be
      used for correspondence with the remittee. Mr. Wexford said he'd bet $500
      that his wife had been using her checks that way, for he said he never
      knew of a woman who could possibly pay postage on a note, remittance or
      anything else unless every particle of the surface had been written over
      in a wild, delirious, three-story hand. Later on I found that he was right
      about it. His wife had been sassing the grocer and the butter-man on the
      back of her checks. Thus ended the great bank mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will close this letter with a little incident the story of which may not
      be so startling, but it is true. It is a story of child faith. Johnny
      Quinlan, of Evanston, has the most wonderful confidence in the efficacy of
      prayer, but he thinks that prayer does not succeed unless it is
      accompanied with considerable physical strength. He believes that adult
      prayer is a good thing, but doubts the efficacy of juvenile prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has wanted a Jersey cow for a good while, and tried prayer, but it
      didn't seem to get to the central office. Last year he went to a neighbor
      who is a Christian and believer in the efficacy of prayer, also the owner
      of a Jersey cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you believe that prayer will bring me a yaller Jersey cow?" said
      Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, of course. Prayer will remove mountains; it will do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, suppose you give me the cow you've got and pray for another
      one."

      A FATHER'S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>Y DEAR SOX: We got
      your last letter some three days ago. It found us all moderately well
      though not very frisky. Your letters now days are getting quite pretty as
      regards penmanship. You are certainly going to develop into a fine penman
      your mother thinks. She says that if you improve as fast in your writing
      next year as you have last, you will soon be writing for the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my mind's eye I can see you there in your room practicing for a long
      time on a spiral spring which you make with your pen. I believe you call
      it the whole arm movement. I think you got the idea from me. You remember
      I used to have a whole arm movement that I introduced into our family
      along in the summer of '69. You was at that time trying to learn to swim.
      Once or twice the neighbors brought you home with your lungs full of river
      water and your ears full of coarse sand. We pumped you dry several times,
      but it did not wean you from the river, so I introduced the whole arm
      movement, one day and used it from that on in what you would call our
      curric kulum. It worked well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letters are now very attractive from a scientific standpoint. The
      letters all have pretty little curly tails on them, and though you do not
      always spell according to Gunter, the capital letters are as pretty as a
      picture. I never saw such a round O as you make when you hang your tongue
      out and begin to swing yourself. Your mother says that your great-uncle on
      her side was a good writer too. He could draw off a turtle dove without
      taking his pen from the paper, and most everybody would know as soon as
      they looked at it that it was a turtle dove or some such bird as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could also draw a deer with coil spring horns on him, and a barbed wire
      fence to it, and a scolloped tail, and it looked as much like a deer as
      anything else you could think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a fine penman and wrote a good deal for the papers. Your mother has
      got a lot of his pieces in the house yet, which the papers sent back
      because they were busy and crowded full of other stuff. I read some of
      these letters, and any one can see that it was a great sacrifice for the
      editors to send the pieces back, but they had got used to it and conquered
      their own personal feelings, and sent them back because they were too good
      for the plain, untutored reader. One editor said that he did not want to
      print the enclosed pieces because he thought it would be a pity to place
      such pretty writing in the soiled hands of the practical printer. He said
      that the manuscript looked so pretty just as it was, that he hadn't the
      heart to send it into the composing room. So the day may not be far away,
      Henry, when you can write for the press, your mother thinks. I don't care
      so much about it myself, but she has her heart set on it. Your mother
      thinks that you are a great man, though I have not detected any symptoms
      of it yet. She has got that last pen scroll work here of yours in the
      bible, where she can look at it every day. Its the picture of a hen
      setting in a nest of curly-cues made with red ink, over a woven wire
      mattress of dewdads in blue ink, and some tall grass in violet ink. Your
      mother says that this fowl is also a turtle dove, but I think she is
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      She says the world has always got a warm place for one who can make such a
      beautiful picture without taking his pen off the paper. Perhaps she is
      right. I hope that you will not take me for an example, for I am no writer
      at all. My parents couldn't give me any advantages when I was young. When
      I ought to have been learning how to make a red ink bird of paradise
      swooping down on a violet ink butterfly with green horns, I was frittering
      away my time trying to keep my misguided parents out of the poor-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you, Henry, there was mighty little fluff and bloom and funny
      business in my young life. While you are acquiring the rudiments of Long
      Dennis and polo and penmanship, and storing your mind with useful
      knowledge with which to parlize your poor parents when you come home, do
      not forget, Henry, that your old sway-back father never had those
      opportunities for soaking his system full of useful knowledge which you
      now enjoy. When I was your age, I was helping to jerk the smutty logs off
      of a new farm with a pair of red and restless steers, in the interest of
      your grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, I do not repine. I just simply call your attention to your
      priviledges. Could you have a Summer in the heart of the primeval forest,
      thrown in contact with a pair of high-strung steers and a large number of
      black flies of the most malignant type, "snaking" half-burnt logs across
      yourself and fighting flies from early dawn till set of sun, you would be
      willing, nay tickled, to go back to your monotonous round of base ball and
      Suffolk jackets and pest-house cigarettes. .
    </p>
    <p>
      We rather expected you home some time ago, but you said you needed sea air
      and change of scene, so you will not be home very likely till the latter
      part of the month. We will be glad to see you any time, Henry, and we will
      try to make it as pleasant as we can for you. Your mother got me to fill
      the big straw-tick for your bed again, so that you would have a nice tall
      place to sleep, and so that you could live high, as the feller said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried on the old velocipede pants you sent home last week. They are too
      short for me with the style of legs I am using this Summer. Your bathing
      pants are also too short for me, so I gave them to a poor woman here who
      is trying to ameliorate the condition of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      I send you our love and $9 in money. We will sell the other calf as soon
      as it is ripe. Chintz bugs are rather more robust than last year, and the
      mortgage on our place looks as if it might mature prematurely. We had a
      lecture on phrenology at the school-house Tuesday night, during which four
      of our this spring's roan turkies wandered so far away from home that they
      lost their bearings and never came back again. So good-by for this time.
      Your father,
    </p>

      THE AZTEC AT HOME
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T HAS been my good
      fortune within the past ten years to witness a number of the remaining
      landmarks left to indicate the trail of the original inhabitant of this
      country. It has been a pleasure, and yet a kind of sad pleasure, to
      examine the crumbling ruins of what was once regarded, no doubt, as the
      very triumph of aboriginal taste and mechanical ingenuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can take but a cursory glance at these earmarks of a forgotten age, for
      a short treatise like this cannot embrace minute details, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are told by the historian that there were originally two distinct
      classes of Indians occupying the territory now embraced by the United
      States, viz., the village Indians or horticultural Indians, and the
      extremely rural Indians or nonhorticultural variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village Indians or horticulturalists subsisted upon fruits and grain,
      ground in a crude way, while the non-horticulturalists lived on wild game,
      berries, acorns and pilgrims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the latter class few traces remain, excepting rude arrow heads and
      coarse stone weapons. These articles show very little skill as a rule, the
      only indication of brains that I ever discovered being on a large stone
      hammer or Mohawk swatter, and they were not the brains of the man who made
      it either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village Indians, however, were architects from away up the gulch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They constructed a number of architectural works of great beauty, several
      of which I have visited. They were once, no doubt, regarded as very
      desirable residences, but now, alas, they have fallen into innocuous
      desuetude&mdash;at least that is what it looked like to me, and the odor
      reminded me of innocuous desuetude in a bad state of preservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In New Mexico, over 300 years ago, there were built a number of pereblos
      or villages which still stand up, in a measure, though some of them are in
      a recumbent position. These pereblos or villages are formed of three or
      four buildings constructed in the retrousse style of architecture, and
      made of adobe bricks. These bricks are generally of a beautiful, soft,
      black and tan color, and at a distance look like the first loaf of bread
      baked by a young lady who has been reared in luxury but whose father has
      been suddenly called away to Canada. The adobe brick is said to be so
      indigestible, in fact, that I am confident the day is not far distant when
      it will be found on every hotel bill of fare in our broad sin-cursed land.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these dwellings was generally about 200 feet long, with no
      stairways in the interior, but movable ladders on the outside instead.
      This manner of reaching the upper floor had its advantages, and yet it was
      not always convenient. One feature in its favor was the isolation which a
      man could pull around himself by going in at the second-story window and
      pulling the ladder up after him, as there was no entrance to the house on
      the ground floor. If a man really courted retirement, and wanted to write
      a humorous lecture or a $2 homily, he could insert himself through the
      second-story window, pull in the staircase and go to work. Then no one
      could disturb him without bribing a hook and ladder company to come along
      and let him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the great drawback was the annoyance incident to ascending these
      ladders at a late hour in the night, while under the influence of Aztec
      rum, a very seductive yet violently intoxicating beverage, containing
      about eight parts cheer to ninety-two parts inebriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      These residences were hardly gothic in style, being extremely rectangular,
      with a tendency toward the more modern dry-goods box. It is believed by
      abler men than I am, men who could believe more in two minutes than I
      could believe in a lifetime if I had nothing else to do, that those houses
      contained about thirty-eight apartments on the first floor and nineteen on
      the second. These apartments were separated by some kind of cheap and
      transitory partition, which could not stand the climatic changes, and so
      has gone to decay; but these Indians were determined to have their rooms
      separated in some way, for they were very polite and decorous to a fault.
      No Aztec gentleman would emerge from his room until he had completed his
      toilet, if it cost him his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once heard of an Aztec who lived away down in old Mexico somewhere
      several centuries ago and who was the pink of politeness. He wore
      full-dress winter and summer, the whole year round, and studied a large
      work on etiquette every evening. At night he would undress himself by
      unhooking the german-silver ring from his nose and hanging it on the back
      of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night a young man from the capital, named Ozone, or something like
      that, a relative of the Montezumas, came over to stay a week or two with
      this Aztec dude. As a good joke he slipped in and nipped the nose-ring of
      his friend just to see if he would so far violate the proprieties as to
      appear at breakfast time without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came and the dude awoke to find the bright rays of a Mexican sun
      streaming in through his casement. He rose, and, bathing himself in a
      gourd, he looked on the back of the chair for his clothing, but it was not
      there. A cold perspiration broke out all over him. He called for
      assistance, but no one came. He called again and again, louder and still
      more loud, but help came not. He went to the casement and looked out upon
      the plaza. The plaza did not turn away. A Mexican plaza is not easily
      dashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called till he was hoarse, but all was still in the house. Hollow
      echoes alone came back to him to mock him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when the rest of the household returned from a protracted picnic
      in the distant hills, young Ozone ascended the ladder which he carried
      with him in a shawl-strap, and entering the room of the Aztec dude gave
      him the nosering with a hearty laugh, but, alas! he was greeted with the
      wild, piercing shriek of a maniac robbed of his clothing; the man had
      suffered such mental tortures during the long, long day, that when night
      came, reason tottered on her throne. It is said that he never regained his
      faculties, but would always greet his visitors with a wild forty-cent
      shriek and bury his face in his hands. His friends tried to get him into
      society again, but he could not be prevailed upon to go. He seemed to be
      afraid that he would be shocked in some way, or that some one might take
      advantage of him and read an immoral poem to him.

      IN THE SOUTH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>SHEVILLE, N.C.,
      December 9.&mdash;There is no place in the United States, so far as I
      know, where the cow is more versatile or ambidextrous, if I may be allowed
      the use of a term that is far above my station in life, than here in the
      mountains of North Carolina, where the obese 'possum and the anonymous
      distiller have their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is the Tar-heel cow the author of a pale but athletic style of
      butter, but in her leisure hours she aids in tilling the perpendicular
      farm on the hillside, or draws the products to market. In this way she
      contrives to put in her time to the best advantage, and when she dies, it
      casts a gloom over the community in which she has resided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of a North Carolina cow is indeed fraught with various changes
      and saturated with a zeal which is praiseworthy in the extreme. From the
      sunny days when she gambols through the beautiful valleys, inserting her
      black, retrousse and perspiration-dotted nose in to the blue grass from
      ear to ear, until at life's close, when every part and portion of her
      overworked system is turned into food, raiment or overcoat buttons, the
      life of the Tar-heel cow is one of intense activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her girlhood is short, and almost before we have deemed her emancipated
      from calfhood herself we find her in the capacity of a mother. With the
      cares of maternity other demands are quickly made upon her. She is obliged
      to ostracize herself from society, and enter into the prosaic details of
      producing small, pallid globules of butter, the very pallor of which so
      thoroughly belies its lusty strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butter she turns out rapidly until it begins to be worth something,
      when she suddenly suspends publication and begins to haul wood to market.
      In this great work she is assisted by the pearl-gray or ecru colored
      jackass of the tepid South. This animal has been referred to in the
      newspapers throughout the country, and yet he never ceases to be an object
      of the greatest interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackasses in the South are of two kinds, viz., male and female. Much as
      has been said of the jackass pro and con, I do not remember ever to have
      seen the above statement in print before, and yet it is as trite as it is
      incontrovertible. In the Rocky mountains we call this animal the burro.
      There he packs bacon, flour and salt to the miners. The miners eat the
      bacon and flour, and with the salt they are enabled to successfully salt
      the mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burro has a low, contralto voice which ought to have some machine oil
      on it. The voice of this animal is not unpleasant if he would pull some of
      the pathos out of it and make it more joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the jackass at times becomes a coworker with the cow in hauling
      tobacco and other necessaries of life into town, but he goes no further in
      the matter of assistance. He compels her to tread the cheese press alone
      and contributes nothing whatever in the way of assistance for the butter
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The North Carolina cow is frequently seen here driven double or single by
      means of a small rope line attached to a tall, emaciated gentleman, who is
      generally clothed with the divine right of suffrage, to which he adds a
      small pair of ear-bods during the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cow is attached to each shaft and a small singletree, or swingletree,
      by means of a broad strap harness. She also wears a breeching, in which
      respect she frequently has the advantage of her escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I have never witnessed a sadder sight than that of a new milch
      cow, torn away from home and friends and kindred dear, descending a steep,
      mountain road at a rapid rate and striving in her poor, weak manner to
      keep out of the way of a small Jackson democratic wagon loaded with a big
      hogshead full of tobacco. It seems to me so totally foreign to the nature
      of the cow to enter into the tobacco traffic, a line of business for which
      she can have no sympathy and in which she certainly can feel very little
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobacco of the very finest kind is produced here, and is used mainly for
      smoking purposes. It is the highest-priced tobacco produced in this
      country. A tobacco broker here yesterday showed me a large quantity of
      what he called export tobacco. It looks very much like other tobacco while
      growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says that foreigners use a great deal of this kind. I am learning all
      about the Tobacco industry while here, and as fast as I get hold of any
      new facts I will communicate them to the press. The newspapers of this
      country have done much for me, not only by publishing many pleasant things
      about me, but by refraining from publishing other things about me, and so
      I am glad to be able, now and then, to repay this kindness by furnishing
      information and facts for which I have no use myself, but which may be of
      incalculable value to the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I write these lines I am informed that the snow is twenty-six inches
      deep here and four feet deep at High Point in this State. People who did
      not bring in their pomegranates last evening are bitterly bewailing their
      thoughtlessness to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many people come here from various parts of the world, for the
      climate. When they have remained here for one winter, however, they decide
      to leave it where it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that the climate here is very much like that of Turin. But I
      did not intend to go to Turin even before I heard about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please send my paper to the same address, and if some one who knows a good
      remedy for chilblains will contribute it to the Sabbath Globe, I shall
      watch for it with great interest. Yours as here 2 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill N ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;I should have said relative to the cows of this State that if
      the owners would work their butter more and their cows less, they would
      confer a great boon on the consumer of both. B. N.

    <h2>
      IN THE PARK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O the general
      public I may say that I violate no confidence in saying that spring is the
      most joyful season of the year. But June is also a good month. Well has
      the poet ejaculated, "And what is so rare as a day in June?" though I have
      seen days in March that were so rare that they were almost raw. This is
      not a weather report; however. I started out to state that Central Park
      just now is looking its very best, and opens up with the prospects of
      doing a good business this season. A ride through the Park just now is a
      delight to one who loves to commune with nature, especially human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobility of New York now turns out to get the glorious air and
      ventilate its crest. I saw several hundred crests and coats-of-arms the
      other day in an hour's time, and it was rather a poor day, too, for a
      great many of our best people are just changing from their spring to their
      light, summer coats-of-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best crests I saw was a nice, large, red crest, about the size
      of an adult rhubarb pie, with a two-year-old Durham unicorn above it,
      bearing in his talons the unique maxim, "<i>Sans culottes, sans
      snockemonthegob, sans ery sipelas est</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      And how true this is, too, in a great many cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another very handsome crest on the carriage of the van Studentickels
      consisted of a towel-rack penchant, with cockroach regardant, holding in
      his beak a large red tape-worm on which was inscribed: "<i>Spirituous
      frumenti, cum homo to-morrow</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the crests contained terse Latin mottoes, taken from the
      inscriptions on peppermint conversation candies, and were quite cute. A
      coat-of-arms, consisting of a small Limburger cheese couchant, above which
      stood a large can of chloride of potash, on which was inscribed the words,
      "Miss, may I see you home?" I thought very taking and just mysterious
      enough to make it exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some day I am going to get myself a crest. I am only waiting for something
      to put it on. It will consist of a monkey with his eye knocked out and a
      bright green parrot with his tail pulled off, and over this the simple
      remark: "We have had a high old time," or words to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so many equestrians were out as usual on the day I visited the park,
      but those who were out afforded the observer a beautiful view of the park
      between their persons and the saddle. The equestriennes were more
      numerous, and one or two especially were as beautiful as anything that
      nature ever turned out. One young woman, in a neat-fitting plug hat,
      looked to me like a peri. It has been a good while now since I saw a peri,
      but I have always heard them very highly spoken of, and I hope she will
      not be offended when she reads these lines and finds that I regard her in
      that light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriage-horses are dressing about as they did last season, except that
      pon-pon tails are more worn, especially at the end. Neck-yokes are cut low
      this year so as to show the shoulders of the wearer, and horses in
      mourning wear their tails at half-mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porous plastron is not in favor this year, but many horses who
      interfere are wearing life-preservers over the fetlock, and sometimes a
      small chest-protector of russet leather over the joint, according to the
      taste of the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polka-dot or half-mourning dogs are much affected by people who are
      beginning to get the upper hand of their grief. Much taste is shown in the
      selection of dogs for the coming season, and many owners chain their
      coachman to the dog, so that if any one were to come and try to abduct the
      dog the coachman could bite him and drive him away. A good coachman to
      take care of a watch-dog is almost invaluable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A custom of taking the butler along in the seat with the coachman is
      growing in favor for two reasons: First, it shows that you have a butler,
      and, second, you know that while he is out with you he is not putting
      paste in the place of your diamonds at home. So I had almost said that it
      paste to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The automatic or jointless footman is still popular, and a young man who
      has a good turning-lathe leg and an air of impenetrable gloom can get a
      job most any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many New York gentlemen who are fond of driving take their grooms out to
      Central Park every afternoon for an airing. This is a wise provision, for
      those who have associated much with grooms will agree with me that a
      little airing now and then is just what they need.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ought to be a book of park etiquette printed soon, however, for the
      guidance of its patrons. In the first place, it should be considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autre for a gentleman to hire a coupe by the hour in order to recover from
      alcoholic prostration, and then sleep up and down the drive with his feet
      out the window. It is not respectful, and besides that the blood is liable
      to all rush to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drunken cab-drivers, too, should not be permitted to drive in the park,
      for only a little while ago one of them is said to have fallen from his
      high perch and injured his crest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A park policeman should be specially detailed as a breath tester to stand
      at each entrance and smell the breath of all drivers and other patrons of
      the park. Let us enforce the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most curious feature about the exhibition afternoon spin in the
      Park is the great prevalence of mourning symbols. Almost, if not quite,
      one-third of the carriages one meets is decorated with black in every
      possible way, till sometimes it looks like a runaway funeral procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why people should come to Central Park to advertise their woe by means of
      long black mourning tassels at their horses' heads and a draped driver
      with broad bands of bombazine concealing the russet tops of his boots,
      sometimes dressed in black throughout, is more than I can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest, earnest and genuine affection of a good woman for a worthy
      man, alive or dead, is too sacred to treat lightly and the love that
      survives the wreck and ruin of gathering years has inspired more than one
      man to deeds of daring whereby he has won everlasting renown, but the woe
      that is divided up among the servants and shared in by the horses is not
      in good taste, it is not in good order and there are flies on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is like saying to the world come and see how I suffer. It is parading
      your sore toe in Central Park, where people with sore toes are not
      supposed to congregate. It is like a widow wailing her woe through the
      "Want" column of a healthy morning paper. It is, in effect, saying to
      Christendom, come and hear me snort and see me paw up the ground in my
      paroxysms of wild and uncontrollable anguish. My grief is of such a
      penetrating nature and of that searching variety that it has broken out at
      the barn, and even the horses that I bought two weeks after the funeral,
      with a part of the life insurance money, have gone into mourning, and the
      coachman who got here day before yesterday from Liverpool has tied himself
      up in black bombazine and takes special delight in advertising our sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not believe that it will always be popular to wear mourning for our
      friends unless we feel a little doubtful about where they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Black is offensive to the eye, offensive to the nose, and it makes your
      flesh crpe to touch it. Will the proofreader please deal gently with the
      above joke and I will do as much for him sometime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Ward Beecher had the right idea of the way to treat death, and when
      at last it came his turn to die his home and his church both seemed to
      say: "The great preacher is gone, but there is nothing about the change
      that is sad."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something the matter with grief that works itself up into black
      rosettes and long black banners that sweep the ground and shut out the sky
      and look like despair and feel like the season-cracked back of a warty
      dragon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But wealth has its little eccentricities and we must bear with them. But
      he alone is indeed rich who is content and who does not look under the bed
      every night for an indictment. Look at poor old Mr. Sharp, with his stock
      of Aldermen depreciating on his hands&mdash;men for whom he paid a big
      price only a few years ago and who would not attract attention now on a
      ten-cent counter, while he don't feel very well himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I would not swap places with J. Sharp and ride through Central Park
      behind a pair of rip, snorting horses, with mourning rosettes on their
      heads, and feel that I must hurry back to help select an unprejudiced
      jury. I would rather hang on to the brow of a Broadway car till I got to
      Fifty-second street, and then stroll over to the menagerie and feed red
      pepper to the Sacred Cow and have a good, plain, quiet time than to wear
      fine clothes and be wealthy and hate myself all the time. I believe that I
      am happier in my untroubled, dreamless sleep on my quiet couch, which
      draws a salary during the daytime as an upright piano; happier browsing
      about at a different restaurant each day, so that the waiters will not get
      well acquainted with me and expect me to give them the money that I am
      saving up to go to Europe with; happier, I say, to be thus tossed about on
      the bosom of the great, heaving human tide than to have forty or fifty
      millions of dollars concealed about my person that I cannot remember how I
      obtained.

      I dislike notoriety, and nothing irritates me more than the coarse
      curiosity of people who ride at night in the elevated trains and peer idly
      into my room as I toil over my sewing or go gayly about humming a simple
      air as I prepare the evening meal over my cute little portable oil stove,
      and though I have not courted this interest on the part of the people, and
      though I would prefer to live less in the eye of the public, I feel that,
      occupying the position I do, I cannot expect to wholly consult my own
      wishes in the matter, and I am content to live quietly and enjoy good
      health rather than wear good clothes and feel rocky all the time.

    <h2>
      LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Patrick Henry
      put his old cast-iron spectacles on the top of his head and whooped for
      liberty, he did not know that some day we would have more of it than we
      knew what to do with. He little dreamed that the time would come when we
      would have more liberty than we could pay for. When Mr. Henry sawed the
      air and shouted for liberty or death, I do not believe that he knew the
      time would one day come when Liberty would stand knee deep in the mud of
      Bedloe's Island and yearn for a solid place to stand upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me that we have too much liberty in this country in some ways.
      We have more liberty than we have money. We guarantee that every man in
      America shall fill himself up full of liberty at our expense, and the less
      of an American he is the more liberty he can have. If he desires to enjoy
      himself, all he needs is a slight foreign accent and a willingness to mix
      up with politics as soon as he can get his baggage off the steamer. The
      more I study American institutions the more I regret that I was not born a
      foreigner, so that I could have something to say about the management of
      our great land. If I could not be a foreigner, I believe I would prefer to
      be a Mormon or an Indian not taxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am often led to ask, in the language of the poet, "Is the Caucasian
      played out?" Most everybody can have a good deal of fun in this country
      except the American. He seems to be so busy paying his taxes all the time
      that he has very little time to mingle in the giddy whirl with the alien.
      That is the reason that the alien who rides across the United States on
      the "Limited Mail" and writes a book about us before breakfast wonders why
      we are always in a hurry. That is the reason we have to throw our meals
      into ourselves with a dull thud, and hardly have time to maintain a warm
      personal friendship with our families.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not care much for wealth, but we must have freedom, and freedom
      costs money. We have advertised to furnish a bunch of freedom to every
      man, woman or child who comes to our shores, and we are going to deliver
      the good whether we have any left for ourselves or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the great world beyond the seas say to us if some day the
      blue-eyed Mormon, with his heart full of love for our female seminaries
      and our old women's homes, should land upon our coasts and find that we
      were using all the liberty ourselves? What do we want of liberty anyhow?
      What could we do with it if we had it? It takes a man of leisure to enjoy
      liberty, and we have no leisure whatever. It is a good thing to keep in
      the house "for the use of guests only," but we don't need it for
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I am in favor of a statue of Liberty Enlightening the World,
      because it will show that we keep it on tap winter and summer. We want the
      whole broad world to remember that when it gets tired of oppression it can
      come here to America and oppress us. We are used to it, and we rather like
      it. If we don't like it, we can get on the steamer and go abroad, where we
      may visit the effete monarchies and have a high old time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the Goddess of Liberty standing there in New York harbor
      night and day, bathing her feet in the rippling sea, will be a good thing.
      It will be first-rate. It may also be productive of good in a direction
      that many have not thought of. As she stands there day after day, bathing
      her feet in the broad Atlantic, perhaps some moss-grown Mormon moving
      toward the Far West, a confirmed victim of the matrimonial habit, may fix
      the bright picture in his so-called mind, and remembering how, on his
      arrival in New York, he saw Liberty bathing her feet with impunity, he may
      be led in after years to try it on himself.

    <h2>
      HE SEES THE CAPITAL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN I got off the
      Pennsylvania train yesterday I went to a barber shop before I did anything
      else. I have a thick, Venetian red, chinchilla beard, which grows rapidly,
      and which gives me a fuzzy appearance every twenty-four hours, unless I
      place myself frequently into the hands of a barber. At first I used to
      shave myself, but I cut myself to pieces in such a sickening manner,
      without seeming to impede the growth of the rich and foxy beard, that
      until last summer I gave up being my own barber. At that time I was
      presented with a safety razor which the manufacturer said would not cut my
      face, because it was impossible for it to cut anything except the beard.
      The safety razor resembles in appearance several other toilet articles,
      such as the spoke shave, the road scraper, the can opener, the lawn mower
      and the turbine water wheel, but it does not look like a razor. It also
      looks like a carpet sweeper some, and reminds me of a monkey wrench. It is
      said that you can shave yourself on a train if you will use this
      instrument. I tried it once last winter while going west. In fact, I took
      the trip largely to see if one could shave on board the train safely with
      this razor. I had no special trouble. At least I did not cut off any
      features that I cared anything about, but I was disappointed in the
      results, and also in the length of time consumed in cleaning the razor
      after I got through. I was shaving myself only from Forty-second street to
      Albany, but it took me from Albany to Omaha to pull the razor apart, and
      to dig out the coagulated lather and the dear, dear whiskers. I now employ
      a valet whose name is Patria McGloria. He irons my trousers, shaves and
      dresses me, and mows the lawn. When I come to Washington, I am too
      democratic to travel with a valet, fearing that it might cost me several
      thousand votes some day, and so I leave my maid at home to wash and dress
      the salad. In that way he does not miss me, and I get the credit at
      Washington of being a man who spends so much time thinking of his
      country's welfare that he doesn't have a chance to look pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not fall into a very gaudy barber shop. The appointments were like
      some of the president's appointments, I thought&mdash;viz., in poor taste,
      but this is not a political letter. I do not wish to antagonize anybody,
      especially the president of the United States. He has always treated me
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will now return to the barber shop. It was a plain structure, with
      beautiful sarsaparilla pictures here and there on the walls and a faint
      odor of rancid pomatum and overworked hair restoratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three chairs richly upholstered in two-ply carpeting of some
      inflammatory hue, with large vines and the kind of flowers which grow on
      carpets but nowhere else. I have seen blossoms woven into ingrain carpets,
      varying in color from a dead black to the color of a hepatized lung, but I
      have never seen one that reminded me of anything I ever saw in nature. The
      chair I sat in also had springs in it. They were made of selections from
      the Washington monument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barber who waited on me asked me if I wanted a shave. A great many
      barbers ask me this during the year. Sometimes they do it from habit, and
      sometimes they do it to brighten up my life and bring a smile to my wan
      cheek. As I have no hair, the thinking mind naturally and by a direct
      course of reasoning arrives at the conclusion that when I go into a barber
      shop and climb into a chair, I do so for the purpose of getting shaved and
      not with the idea of having my fortune told or my deposition taken. Still
      barbers continue to ask me this question and look at each other with ill
      concealed mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said yes, I would like a shave unless he preferred to take my
      temperature, or amuse me by making a death mask of himself. He then began
      to strap a large razor with a double shuffle movement and to size me up at
      the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a colored man, but he had lived in Washington a long time and knew
      a great deal more than he would if his lot had fallen elsewhere. He spoke
      with some feeling and fed me with about the most unpalatable lather I
      think I ever participated in. He also did an odd thing when he went for
      the second time over my face. I never have noticed the custom outside of
      that shop. Most barbers, in making the second trip over a customer's face,
      moisten one side at a time with a sponge or the damp hand as they go
      along, but in this case a large quantity of lather was put in my ear and,
      as he needed it, he took out what he required from time to time, using his
      finger like a paint brush and spreading on the lather as he went along. So
      accurately had he learned to measure the quantity of lather which an ear
      will hold that when he got through with me and I went away there was not
      over a tablespoonfnl in either ear and possibly not that much.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I sat in the chair I heard a man, who seemed to be in about the
      third chair from me, saying that a certain bill numbered so-and-so had
      been referred to a certain committee and would undoubtedly by reported
      favorably. If so, it would in its regular order come up for discussion and
      reach a vote so-and-so. I was charmed with the man's knowledge of the
      condition of affairs in both houses and the exact status of all threatened
      legislation, because I always have to stop and think a good while before I
      can tell whether a bill originates on the floor of the house or in the
      rotunda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not see this man, but I judged that he was a senator or
      sergeant-at-arms. He talked for some time about the condition of national
      affairs, and finally some one said something about evolution. I was
      perfectly wrapped up in what he was saying and remember distinctly how he
      referred to Herbert Spencer's definition of evolution as a change from
      indefinite, coherent heterogeneity through continuous differentiations and
      integrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I arose from my chair and looked over that way I saw that the
      gentleman who had been talking on the condition of congressional
      legislation was a colored hotel porter of Washington, who was getting
      shaved in the third chair, and the man who was discussing the merits of
      evolution was the colored man who was shaving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in Washington the colored man has the air of one who is holding up
      one corner of the great national structure. Whether he is opening your
      soft boiled eggs for you in the morning, or putting bay rum on your nose,
      or checking your umbrella or brushing you with a wilted whisk broom, his
      thoughts are mostly upon national affairs. He is naturally an imitator
      wherever he goes, and this old resident of Washington has watched and
      studied the air and language of eminent statesmen so carefully that when
      he goes forth in the morning with his whitewashing portfolio on his arm he
      walks unconsciously like Senator Evarts or John James Ingalls. I saw a
      colored man taking a perpendicular lunch at the depot yesterday, and
      evidently the veteran Georgia senator is his model, for he cut his custard
      pie into large rectangular hunks and pushed it back behind his glottis
      with a caseknife, after which he drew in a saucerful of tea, with a loud
      and violent ways-and-means committee report which reminded me of the noise
      made by an unwearied cyclone trying to suck a cistern dry. I think that
      the colored man exaggerated the imitation somewhat, but he was evidently
      trying to assume the table manners of Senator Brown of Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason, if for no other, members of the cabinet, senators,
      representatives, judges and heads of departments cannot be too careful in
      their daily walk and conversation. Unconsciously they are molding the
      customs, the manners, and the styles of dress which are to become the
      customs, the manners, and the dress of a whole race. If I could to-day
      take our statesmen all apart, not so much for the purpose of examining
      their works, but so that we could be alone and talk this matter over by
      ourselves, I would strive in my poor, weak, faltering way to impress upon
      them the awful responsibility which rests upon them not only as polite and
      fluent conversationalists, classical and courteous debators. speaking
      pieces for the benefit of future conventions, of referring to each other
      as liars, traitors, thieves, deserters, bummers, beats, and great moral
      abscesses on the body politic; rehearsing campaign speeches in congress at
      an expense of $20 per day each, and meantime obstructing wholesome tariff
      legislation, but as the conservators of etiquette, statesmanship, and
      morality for a race of people the great responsibility for whose welfare
      still rests upon us as a nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the day before yesterday I saw a thin, wiry, and colored gentleman
      pawing around in an ash barrel for something, and I waited to see what he
      was after. He resurrected a sad and dejected plug hat, and, though it was
      not half so good as the one he wore, he seemed much pleased with it and
      put it on. I ventured to ask him why he had done so without improving his
      appearance, and he said that for a long time he had been looking for a hat
      which would highten the resemblance which people had often noticed and
      remarked in days gone by, both in person, sah, and general carriage, walk,
      and conversation, sah, also in the matter of clear cut and logical life
      sentences, as existing between himself, sah, and Senator Evarts, sah. He
      believed that he had struck it, sah.
    </p>
    <p>
      As spring warms up the air about Washington the heating apparatus of the
      capitol building begins to relax its interest, and now you can visit most
      any part of the stately pile without being scrambled in your own
      embonpoint. Last winter I heard Senator Frye of Maine make his great
      tariff speech, and although there was nothing, about the speech itself
      which seemed to evolve much exercise or industry&mdash;for it was the same
      speech in every essential quality that I have heard every November since I
      began to take an interest in politics&mdash;the perspiration ran down his
      face in small washouts and sweatlets and fell in the arena with a mellow
      plunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe this unnatural heat to be the cause of much ill health among our
      law-makers, and I freely admit that the unhealthy surroundings of
      Washington and the great contrast between the hot air of the capitol and
      the cold air outside have done a great deal towards keeping me out of the
      senate. The night air of Washington is also filled with malaria and is
      much worse than any night air I have ever used before.

    <h2>
      HE SEES THE NAVY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T HAS become such
      a general practice to speak disrespectfully of the United States Navy that
      a few days ago I decided to visit the Brooklyn Navy Yard for the purpose
      of ascertaining, if possible, how much cause there might be for this light
      and airy manner of treating the navy, and, if necessary, to take immediate
      steps towards purifying the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found that the matter had been grossly misrepresented, and that our
      navy, so far as I was able to discover, is self-sustaining. It has been
      thoroughly refitted and refurnished throughout, and is as pleasant a navy
      as one would see in a day's journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the pleasure of boarding the man-of-war Richmond under a flag of
      truce and the Atlantic under a suspension of the rules. I remained some
      time on board each of these war ships, and any man who speaks lightly of
      the United States Navy in my presence hereafter will receive a stinging
      rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brooklyn Navy Yard was inaugurated by the purchase of forty acres of
      ground in 1801. It has a pleasant water-front, which is at all times
      dotted here and there with new war vessels undergoing repairs. Since the
      original purchase others have been made and the land side of the yard
      inclosed by means of a large brick wall, so that in case there should be a
      local disturbance in Brooklyn the rioters could not break through and bite
      the navy. In this way a man on board the Atlanta while at anchor in
      Brooklyn is just as safe as he would be at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to enter and explore the Navy Yard it is necessary that one
      should have a pass. This is a safeguard, wisely adopted by the Commandant,
      in order to keep out strangers who might get in under the pretext of
      wishing to view the yard and afterwards attack one of the new vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day I visited the Navy Yard just ahead of me a plain but dignified
      person in citizen's dress passed through the gate. He had the bearing of
      an officer, I thought, and kept his eye on some object about nine and
      one-fourth miles ahead as he walked past the guard. He was told to halt,
      but, of course, he did not do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was above it. Then the guard overhauled him, and even felt in his
      pockets for his pass, as I supposed. Concealed on his person the guard
      found four pint bottles filled with the essence of crime. They poured the
      poor man's rum on the grass and then fired him out, accompanied by a
      rebuke which will make him more deliberate about sitting down for a week
      or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feeling against arduous spirits in the United States Navy is certainly
      on the increase, and the day is not far distant when alcohol in a free
      state will only be used in the arts, sciences, music, literature and the
      drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Richmond is a large but buoyant vessel painted black. It has a front
      stairway hanging over the balcony, and the latch-string to the front door
      was hanging cheerily out as we drew alongside. During an engagement,
      however, on the approach of the enemy, the front stairs are pulled up and
      the latch-string is pulled in, while the commanding officer makes the
      statement, "April Fool" through a speaking-trumpet to the chagrined and
      infuriated foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Richmond is a veteran of the late war, a war which no one ever
      regretted more than I did; not so much because of the bloodshed and
      desolation it caused at the time, but on account of the rude remarks since
      made to those who did not believe in the war and whose feelings have been
      repeatedly hurt by reference to it since the war closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guns of the Richmond are muzzle-loaders, <i>i.e.</i>, the load or
      charge of ammunition is put into the other or outer end of the gun instead
      of the inner extremity or base of the gun, as is the case with the
      breech-loader. The breech-loader is a great improvement on the old style
      gun, making warfare a constant source of delirious joy now, whereas in
      former times in case of a naval combat during a severe storm, the man who
      went outside the ship to load the gun, while it was raining, frequently
      contracted pneumonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern guns are made with breeches, which may be easily removed during a
      fight and replaced when visitors come on board. A sort of grim humor
      pervades the above remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Richmond is about to sail away to China. I do not know why she is
      going to China but presume she does not care to be here during the
      amenities, antipathies and aspersions of a Presidential campaign. A
      man-of-war would rather make some sacrifices generally than to get into
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must here say that I would rather be captured by our naval officers than
      by any other naval officers I have ever seen. The older officers were calm
      and self-possessed during my visit on board both the Richmond and Atlanta,
      and the young fellows are as handsome as a steel engraving. While gazing
      on them as they proudly trod the quarter deck or any other deck that
      needed it, I was proud of my sex, and I could not help thinking that had I
      been an unprotected but beautiful girl, hostile to the United States, I
      could have picked out five or six young men there to either of whom I
      would be glad to talk over the details of an armistice. I could not help
      enjoying fully my hospitable treatment by the officers above referred to
      after having been only a little while before rudely repulsed and most
      cruelly snubbed by a haughty young cotton-sock broker in a New York store.
    </p>
    <p>
      When will people ever learn that the way to have fun with me is to treat
      me for the time being as an equal?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wash-day on board ship, and I could not help noticing how the
      tyrant man asserts himself when he becomes sole boss of the household. The
      rule on board a man-of-war is that the first man who on wash-day shall
      suggest a "picked-up dinner" shall be loaded into the double-barrelled
      howitzer and shot into the bosom of Venus.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the clothes-line I noticed very few frills. The lingerie on board a war
      vessel is severe in outline and almost harsh in detail. Here the salt
      breezes search in vain for the singularly sawed-off and fluently trimmed
      toga of our home life. Here all is changed. From the basement to the top
      of the lightning rod, from pit to dome, as I was about to say, a
      belligerent ship on washday is not gayly caparisoned.

      The Atlanta is a fair representative of the modern war vessel and would be
      the most effective craft in the world if she could use her guns. She has
      all the modern improvements, hot and cold water, electric lights, handy to
      depots and a good view of the ocean, but when she shoots off her guns they
      pull out her circles, abrade her deck, concuss her rotunda, contuse the
      main brace and injure people who have always been friendly to the
      Government. Her guns are now being removed and new circles put in, so that
      in future she would be enabled to give less pain to her friends and squirt
      more gloom into the ranks of the enemy. She is at present as useful for
      purposes of defense as a revolver in the bottom of a locked-up bureau
      drawer, the key of which is in the pocket of your wife's dress in a dark
      closet, wherein also the burglar is, for the nonce, concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics has very little to do with the conduct of a navy-yard. No one
      would talk politics with me. I could not arouse any interest there at all
      in the election. Every one seemed delighted with the present
      Administration, however. The navy-yard always feels that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the choky or brig at the guard-house I saw a sailor locked up who was
      extremely drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you get it here, my man?" I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through thinfloonee of prominent Democrat, you damphool. Howje spose?" he
      unto me straightway did reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor is sometimes infested with a style of arid humor which asserts
      itself in the most unlooked-for fashion. I laughed heartily at his odd yet
      coarse repartee, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard-house contains a choice collection of manacles, handcuffs, lily
      irons and other rare gems. The lily irons are not now in use. They consist
      of two iron bands for the wrists, connected by means of a flat iron, which
      can be opened up to let the wrists into place; then they are both locked
      at one time by means of a wrench like the one used by a piano-tuner. With
      a pair of lily irons on the wrists and another pair on the ankles a man
      locked in the brig and caught out 2,000 miles at sea in a big gale, with
      the rudder knocked off the ship and a large litter of kittens in the steam
      cylinder, would feel almost helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had almost forgotten to mention the drug store on board ship. Each
      man-of-war has a small pharmacy on the second floor. It is open all night,
      and prescriptions are carefully compounded. Pure drugs, paints, oils,
      varnishes and putty are to be had there at all times. The ship's
      dispensary is not a large room, but two ordinary men and a truss would not
      feel crowded there. The druggists treated me well on board both ships, and
      offered me my choice of antiseptics and anodynes, or anything else I might
      take a fancy to. I shall do my trading in that line hereafter on board
      ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Atlanta has many very modern improvements, and is said to be a
      wonderful sailor. She also has a log. I saw it. It does not look exactly
      like what I had, as an old lumberman, imagined that it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a book, with writing in it, about the size of the tax-roll for 1888.
      In the cupola of the ship, where the wheel is located, there is also a big
      brass compass about as large as the third stomach of a cow. In this there
      is a little index or dingus, which always points towards the north. That
      is all it has to do. On each side of the compass is a large cannon ball so
      magnetized or polarized or influenced as to overcome the attraction of the
      needle for some desirable portion of the ship. There is also an index
      connected with the shaft whereby the man at the wheel can ascertain the
      position of the shaft and also ascertain at night whether the ship is
      advancing or retreating&mdash;a thing that he should inform himself about
      at the earliest possible moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The culinary arrangements on board these ships would make many a hotel
      blush, and I have paid $1 a day for a worse room than the choky at the
      guard-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Navy-Yard at Brooklyn is the big iron hull or running gears of an
      old ship of some kind which the Republicans were in the habit of hammering
      on for a few weeks prior to election every four years. Four years ago,
      through an oversight, the workmen were not called off nor informed of
      Blaine's defeat for several days after the election..
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats have an entirely different hull in another part of the yard
      on which they are hammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keel blocks of a new cruiser, 375 feet long are just laid in the big
      ship-house at the Brooklyn Navy-Yard. She will be a very airy and cheerful
      boat, I judge, if the keel blocks are anything to go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      In closing this account I desire to state that I hope I have avoided the
      inordinate use of marine terms, as I desire to make myself perfectly clear
      to the ordinary landsman, even at the expense of beauty and style of
      description. I would rather be thoroughly understood than confuse the
      reader while exerting myself to show my knowledge of terms. I also desire
      to express my thanks to the United States Navy for its kindness and
      consideration during my visit. I could have been easily blown into space
      half a dozen times without any opportunity to blow back through the
      papers, had the navy so desired, and yet nothing but terms of endearment
      passed between the navy and myself.

    <h2>
      MORE ABOUT WASHINGTON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ASHINGTON, D.C. I
      Have just returned from a polite and recherche party here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington is the hot-bed of gayety, and general headquarters for the
      recherche business. It would be hard to find a bontonger aggregation than
      the one I was just at, to use the words of a gentleman who was there, and
      who asked me if I wrote "The Heathen Chinee."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very talented man, with a broad sweep of skull and a vague
      yearning for something more tangible&mdash;to drink. He was in Washington,
      he said, in the interests of Mingo county. I forgot to ask him where Mingo
      county might be. He took a great interest in me, and talked with me long
      after he really had anything to say. He was one of those fluent
      conversationalists frequently met with in society. He used one of these
      web-perfecting talkers&mdash;the kind that can be fed with raw Roman punch
      and that will turn out punctuated talk in links, like varnished sausages.
      Being a poor talker myself and rather more fluent as a listener, I did not
      interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he was sorry to notice how young girls and their parents came
      to Washington as they would to a matrimonial market.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry also to hear it. It pained me to know that young ladies should
      allow themselves to be bamboozled into matrimony. Why was it, I asked,
      that matrimony should ever single out the young and fair?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said he, "it is indeed rough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He then breathed a sigh that shook the foliage of the speckled geranium
      near by, and killed an artificial caterpillar that hung on its branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matrimony is all right," said he, "if properly brought about. It breaks
      my heart, though, to notice how Washington is used as a matrimonial
      market. It seems to me almost as if these here young ladies were brought
      here like slaves and exposed for sale." I had noticed that they were
      somewhat exposed, but I did not know that they were for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him if the waists of party dresses had always been so sadly in the
      minority, and he said they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      I danced with a beautiful young lady whose trail had evidently caught in a
      doorway. She hadn't noticed it till she had walked out partially through
      her costume. I do not think a lady ought to give too much thought to her
      apparel, neither should she feel too much above her clothes. I say this in
      the kindest spirit, because I believe that man should be a friend to
      woman. No family circle is complete without a woman. She is like a glad
      landscape to the weary eye. Individually and collectively, woman is a
      great adjunct of civilization and progress. The electric light is a good
      thing, but how pale and feeble it looks by the light of a good woman's
      eyes. The telephone is a great invention. It is a good thing to talk at
      and murmur into and deposit profanity in, but to take up a conversation
      and keep it up and follow a man out through the front door with it, the
      telephone has still much to learn from woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that our government officials are not sufficiently paid, and I
      presume that is the case, so it became necessary to economize in every
      way, but, why should wives concentrate all their economy on the waist of a
      dress? When chest protectors are so cheap as they now are, I hate to see
      people suffer, and there is more real suffering, more privation and more
      destitution, pervading the Washington scapula and clavicle this winter
      than I ever saw before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I do not hope to change this custom, though I spoke to several ladies
      about it, and asked them to think it over. I do not think they will. It
      seems almost wicked to cut off the best part of a dress and put it at the
      other end of the skirt, to be trodden under feet of men, as I may say.
      They smiled good humoredly at me as I tried to impress my views upon them,
      but should I go there again next season and mingle in the mad whirl of
      Washington, where these fair women are also mingling in said mad whirl, I
      presume that I will find them clothed in the same gaslight waist, with
      trimmings of real vertebr down the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, what does a man know about the proper costume for woman? He knows
      nothing whatever. He is in many ways a little inconsistent. Why does a man
      frown on a certain costume for his wife and admire it on the first woman
      he meets? Why does he fight shy of religion and Christianity and talk very
      freely about the church, but get mad if his wife is an infidel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crops around Washington are looking well. Winter wheat, crocusses and
      indefinite postponements were never in a more thrifty condition. Quite a
      number of people are here who are waiting to be confirmed. Judging from
      their habits, they are lingering around here in order to become confirmed
      drunkards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leave here to-morrow with a large, wet towel in my plug hat. Perhaps I
      should have said nothing on this dress reform question while my hat is
      fitting me so immediately. It is seldom that I step aside from the beaten
      path of rectitude, but last evening, on the way home, it seemed to me that
      I didn't do much else but step aside. At these parties no charge is made
      for punch. It is perfectly free. I asked a colored man who stood near the
      punch bowl, and who replenished it ever and anon, what the damage was, and
      he drew himself up to his full height.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly I did wrong, but I hate to be a burden on any one. It seemed odd
      to me to go to a first-class dance and find the supper and the band and
      the rum all paid for. It must cost a good deal of money to run this
      government.

      A GREAT BENEFACTOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS not
      generally known at the time, but about a year ago a gentleman from
      Jays-burg, named Alanson G-. Meltz, opened a law office in Chicago,
      intending to give that city a style of clear-cut counseling, soliciting,
      conveyancing, prosecuting and defending, such as she had never witnessed
      before. He was young, but he was full of confidence, and as he pulled the
      nails out of the dry goods boxes, in which he had brought his revised
      statutes and replevin appliances, he felt ready and willing to furnish
      advice at living rates to all who would come and examine his stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time kept on in his remorseless flight, bringing in at the casement of
      Mr. Meltz the roar and hum of traffic, and the nut-brown flavor of the
      Chicago river, but that was all. He was there, ready and almost eager to
      advise one and all, but one and all, without exception, evaded him. No
      matter how gayly he lettered his window with the announcement that he
      would procure a divorce for any one without pain, married people continued
      to suffer on or go elsewhere. Even though he had put up a transparency:
    </p>
    <h3>
      DIVORCES PREPARED
    </h3>
    <h3>
      WHILE YOU WAIT!
    </h3>
    <p>
      No one called at his office, No. 61 Water street, to get one. Day after
      day innumerable people went by him in the mad rush and hurry of life,
      married but not mated, forgetting that Mr. Meltz could relieve them
      without publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remorseless time had rolled on in this way for three months, now and then
      picking out a fragment of the cornice on the new court-house and braining
      a pedestrian with it, when one day Mr. Meltz was solicited by the
      proprietor of a new remedy for indigestion and brain-fever to try his
      medicine. He also told Mr. Meltz that in case of cure or beneficial
      effects he desired to use his endorsement, and as the remedy was new he
      proposed to issue an edition of 1,000,000 circulars containing the
      endorsement of prominent professional people of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alanson G. Meltz bought a bottle and began using it. In three weeks the
      following endorsement entered over a million and a half families in the
      United States at the expense of the man who owned the remedy:
    </p>
    <p>
      Chicago, Dec. 13, 1883.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. J. Burdock Wells.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir: I am a lawyer of this city, and for the past year have been seriously
      and dangerously afflicted with sharp, darting pains up and down the spinal
      column, dimness of sight, acidity of the tonsils and in-growing spleen. I
      suffered the agonies of the d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take this method of informing the world, especially those who may be
      suffering as I did, that less than a month ago I was in a pitiful state. I
      have a large practice, especially as an attorney, in procuring noiseless
      divorces. My office is at No. 6 5/8 South Water Street, and for years I
      have been engaged in this line, procuring divorces for thousands
      everywhere, orders filled by mail, etc., by a new system of my own, by
      which applicants throughout the union may be treated at a distance as well
      as in my office.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had so taken up my time and engrossed my attention that, before I
      knew it, my health had become impaired materially, and I did not know at
      any time but that the next succeeding moment might be my subsequent one.
      With clients calling on me and pressing me by mail for their services,
      with persistent people hurrying and urging me for divorces, so that they
      could marry some one else without unnecessary delay, I was stricken down
      with ingrowing spleen and gastric yearning of the most violent character.
      My physicians gave me up. They said I could never recover. I was in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, came Dr. J.
      Burdock Wells, with a bottle of his unerring Bile Renovator and Gastric
      Rectifier. I took one bottle and called for another. In a little while I
      began to hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I arose in the morning my mouth did not taste like that of a total
      stranger any more. In one week my eye had recovered its old brilliancy,
      and in ten days I was back in my office again at No. 6 5/8 South Water
      Street, rapidly catching up with my large business and answering all calls
      made upon me from all quarters. I have not only regained my health, but I
      have been the humble means, since my recovery, of bringing peace to many
      an aching heart. One man from Kansas writes me: "Your recovery was indeed
      a great boon to me. You have saved my life. Whenever I want a divorce
      again I shall surely go to you. God bless you and prolong your life for
      many years that you may go on spreading joy and hope again throughout our
      broad land, furnishing your automatic and delightful divorces to those who
      suffer." I can most heartily endorse Dr. J. Burdock Wells' remedy and
      would cheerfully recommend it to those who have tried everything else
      without success. I would be glad to have any or all who suffer call at my
      office, No. 6 5/8 South Water street, if they doubt my recovery, when they
      will find me removing superfluous husbands or wives absolutely without
      pain.

      A man who visited Mr. Meltz' office last week says that his business is
      simply enormous, and that he has added to his former office the gorgeous
      room at No. 7 1/8 People are now coming from all quarters of the globe to
      get Mr. Meltz to administer his divorces to them.

      THE COUPON LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE interchange of
      letters of introduction between old friends, by which valuable
      acquaintances are added to the list, is a great blessing, and in good
      hands these letters have, no doubt, been the beginning of many a warm
      friendship; but, like all other blessings, it has been greatly abused. I
      have been the recipient of letters, presented by tourists, which, it was
      easy to see, had been wrung from some sandbagged friend of mine&mdash;letters
      with sobs between the lines, letters punctuated with invisible signals,
      calling upon me to remember that the bearer had looked over the writer's
      shoulder as each sentence grew into a polite prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who are in the habit of giving hearty letters of introduction and
      endorsement to casual acquaintances, I desire to say that I am perfecting
      a system by which the drugged and kidnapped writer of a style of assumed
      sincerity and bogus hilarity will be thoroughly protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me explain briefly and then illustrate my method.
    </p>
    <p>
      A casual acquaintance, who has met you, say four or five times, and who
      feels thoroughly intimate with you, calling you by the name that no one
      uses but your wife, approaches you with an air of confidence that betrays
      his utter ignorance of himself, and asks for a letter of introduction (in
      the same serious vein in which one asks for a match). You are already
      provided with my numbered Introductory Letter Pad. You write the letter of
      introduction on a sheet numbered to correspond with a letter of advice
      mailed simultaneously to the person who is to submit to the letter of
      introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a young man, inclined to be fresh, enters your office or
      library and states that he is going abroad. He has learned that you are
      intimate with Dom Pedro, of Brazil. Perhaps you have conveyed that idea
      unintentionally while in the young man's presence at some time. So now he
      asks the trifling favor of a letter of introduction to the Emperor. He is
      going to see the President and Cabinet and the members of the Supreme
      Court before he leaves this country, and when he goes to South America he
      naturally wants to meet Dom Pedro.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you fill out the right-hand end or coupon of the sheet as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      [International Introductory Letter System, Form Z 23.]

    </p>
    <p>
      Sir: You will please honor this letter of introduction in accordance with
      the terms of a certain letter of advice numbered as above, and bearing
      even date herewith, mailed to you this day, and oblige, Yours, etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man goes abroad with this letter inclosed in a maroon
      alligator-skin pocket-book, and when he arrives in Brazil he finds that
      the way has been paved for him by the following letter of advice:

      Sir: Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a young man with great assurance and a
      maroon-colored alligator-skin pocket-book, bearing a letter of
      introduction to you numbered as above, is now at large. He will visit
      Europe for a few weeks, after which he will tour about South America. He
      will make a specialty of volcanoes and monarchs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will offer to exchange photographs with you, but you must use your own
      judgment about complying with this request. Do not allow this letter to
      influence you in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will readily recognize him by the wonderful confidence which he has in
      himself, and which is not shared by those who know him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a fluent conversationalist, and can talk for hours without fatigue
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will find it very difficult to wound his feelings, but there would be
      no harm in trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you get this letter in time, you might do as you thought best in
      the matter of quarantine. Some foreign powers are doing that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;has met a great many prominent people in this
      country. What this country needs is more free trade on the high seas and
      better protection for its prominent people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried to be conservative in what I have said here, and if I have
      given you a better opinion of the young man than his conduct on fuller
      acquaintance will warrant, I assure you that I have not done so
      intentionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will notice at once that he is a self-made man, so your admiration for
      the works of nature need not be in any way diminished. With due respect,
      your most obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      A. B.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his Imperial Highness D. Pedro, Esq.,
    </p>
    <p>
      Brazil, S. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Z 30,805.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir: This letter of advice will probably precede a tall youth named
      Brindley. Mr. Brindley is a young man who, by a strange combination of
      circumstances, is the eldest son of a perfect gentleman, who now has, and
      will ever continue to have, my highest esteem and my promissory note for
      $250.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you kindly bear this in mind while you peruse my pleading letter of
      introduction, which will accompany Mr. Brindley, Jr.?
    </p>
    <p>
      All through his stormy and tempestuous career in the capacity of son to
      his father, he has never done anything that the grand jury could get hold
      of. Treat him as well as you can consistently, and if you can get him a
      position in a bank, I am sure his father would appreciate it. A place in a
      bank, where he would not have anything to do but look pretty and declare
      dividends in a shrill falsetto voice, would please him very much. He is a
      very good declaimer. He is not accustomed to manual toil, but he has
      always yearned to do literary work. If he could do the editorial work
      connected with the sight-draft department, or write humorous indorsements
      on the backs of checks, over a <i>nom deplume</i>, it would tickle the boy
      almost to death. Anything you could do toward getting him a position in a
      large bank that is nailed down securely, would be thoroughly appreciated
      by me, and I should be glad to retaliate at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours candidly,
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyman Dayton.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. K. O. Peck, London.
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful feature of this invaluable system is the understanding to
      which everybody is committed, that the original letter is entirely
      worthless on its presentation unless the letter of advice has been already
      received.

    <h2>
      HOW TO TEACH JOURNALISM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> AM GLAD to know
      Cornell University is to I establish a department of journalism next
      September. I have always claimed that journalism could be taught in
      universities and colleges just as successfully as any other athletic
      exercise. Of course you cannot teach a boy how to jerk a giant journal
      from the clutches of decay and make of it a robust and rip snorting shaper
      and trimmer of public opinion, in whose counting-room people will walk all
      over each other in their mad efforts to insert advertisements. You cannot
      teach this in a school any more than you can teach a boy how to discover
      the open Polar Sea, but you can teach him the rudiments and save him a
      good deal of time experimenting with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boys spend small fortunes and the best years of their lives learning the
      simplest truths in relation to journalism. We grope on blindly, learning
      this year perhaps how to distinguish an italic shooting-stick when we see
      it, or how to eradicate type lice from a standing galley, learning next
      year how to sustain life on an annual pass and a sample early-rose potato
      weighing four pounds and measuring eleven inches in circumference. This is
      a slow and tedious way to obtain journalistic training. If this can be
      avoided or abbreviated it will be a great boon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I understand it, the department in Cornell University will not deal so
      much with actual newspaper experience as it will with construction and
      style in writing. This is certainly a good move, for we must admit that we
      can improve very greatly our style and the purity of our English. For
      instance, I select an exchange at random, and on the telegraphic page I
      find the details of a horrible crime. It seems that an old lady, who lived
      by herself almost, and who had amassed between $16 and $17, was awakened
      by an assassin, dragged from her bed and cruelly murdered. The large
      telegraph headline reads: "Drug from her bed and murdered!" This is
      incorrect in orthography, syntax and prosody, bad in form and inelegant in
      style. Carefully parsing the word drug as it appears here, I find that it
      does not agree with anything in number, gender or person. I do not like to
      criticise the style of others when I know that my own is so faulty, but I
      am sure that the word drug should not be used in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the following, also, from the Kansas correspondence of the
      Statesville (N.C.) <i>Landmark</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were several bad accidents in and around Clear Water during my
      absence from home. The saddest one was the shooting of one Peter Peterson
      by his father. They were out rabbit-hunting in the snow. A rabbit got up
      and started to run. The son was in a swag of a place and the father was
      taking aim at the rabbit. The son at the same time was trying to get a
      shot at it and, not knowing that his father was shooting, ran between the
      rabbit and his father and was killed dead, falling on the snow with his
      gun grasped in his hands and never moved. He still carried that pleasant
      smile which he had on, in expectation of shooting that jack rabbit, when
      put in the grave. Wheat is selling at about 60 cents; corn, 40 to 50
      cents; fat hogs, gross, 44 to 41; fat steers, 41; butcher's stock, 2
      cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to say just exactly wherein this is faulty, but something is
      the matter with it. I would like to get an expression of opinion from
      those who take an interest in such things, as to whether the fault is in
      orthoepy, orthography, anatomy, obituary or price current, or whether it
      consists in writing several features too closely in the same paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would also be a good idea to establish a chair for advertisers in some
      practical college, in order that they might run in for a few hours and
      learn how to write an advertisement so that it would express in the most
      direct way what they desired to state. Here is an advertisement, for
      instance, which is given exactly as written and punctuated:
    </p>

      THE GREAT WESTERN CLAIRVOYANT,
    </h2>
    <p>
      Has arrived, and-will remain only a short time. Call at once at HOTEL
      WINDSOR, 119, 121 and 123 East State street, Room 19, third floor. Please
      take elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest and most natural born, and highly celebrated, and well-known
      all over the country, Clairvoyant, now traveling on the road, and Wonder
      from the Pacific coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventh Daughter of the Seventh Daughter; born with veil and second sight;
      every mystery revealed; if one you love is true or false; removes trouble;
      settles lovers' quarrels; causes a speedy marriage with one you Jove;
      valuable information to gentlemen on all business transactions; how to
      make profitable investments for speedy riches; lucky numbers; Egyptian
      talisman for the un lucky; cures mysterious and chronic diseases. All who
      are sick or in trouble from any cause are invited to call without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always claimed that clairvoyance could be made a success if we
      could find some one who was sufficiently natural born to grapple with it.
      Now, Mrs. Edwards seems to know what is required. She was born utterly
      without affectation. When she was born she just seemed to say to those who
      happened to be present at the time, "Fellow citizens, you will have to
      take me just as you find me. I cannot dissemble or appear to be otherwise
      than what I am. I am the most natural born and highly celebrated all over
      the country clairvoyant now traveling on the road, and Wonder from the
      Pacific coast." She then let off a whoop that ripped open the sable robes
      of night, after which she took a light lunch and retired to her
      dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ex-Mayor Henry C. Robinson, of Hartford, Conn., if I am not mistaken,
      suggested a school of journalism at least twelve years ago, but it did not
      meet with immediate and practical indorsement. Now Cornell comes forward
      and seems to be in earnest, and I am glad of it. The letters received from
      day to day by editors, and written to them by men engaged in other
      pursuits, practically admit and prove that there is not now in existence
      an editor who knows enough to carry liver to a bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the reason why every means should be used to pull this profession
      out of the mire of dense ignorance and place it upon the high, dry soil
      which leads to genius and consanguinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above paragraph I quote from a treatise on journalism which I wrote
      just before I knew anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of the journalist is a hard one, and, although it is not so
      trying as the life of the newspaper man, it is full of trials and
      perplexities. If newspaper men and journalists did not stand by each other
      I do not know what joy they would have. Kindness for each other,
      gentleness and generosity, even in their rivalry, characterize the conduct
      of a large number of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget my first opportunity to do a kind act for a fellow
      newspaper man, nor with what pleasure I availed myself of it, though he
      was my rival, especially in the publication of large and spirited
      equestrian handbills and posters. He also printed a rival paper and
      assailed me most bitterly from time to time. His name was Lorenzo Dow
      Pease, and we had carried on an acrimonious warfare for two years. He had
      said that I was a reformed Prohibitionist and that I had left a neglected
      wife in every State in the Union. I had stated that he would give better
      satisfaction if he would wear his brains breaded. Then he had said
      something else that was personal and it had gone on so for some time. We
      devoted fifteen minutes each day to the management of our respective
      papers, and the balance of the day to doing each other up in a way to
      please our subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Lorenzo Dow Pease came into my office and said he wanted to
      see me personally. I said that would suit me exactly and that if he had
      asked to see me in any other way I did not know how I could have arranged
      it. He said he meant that he would like to see me by myself. I therefore
      discharged the force, turned out the dog and we had the office to
      ourselves. I could see that he was in trouble, for every little while he
      would brush away a tear in an underhanded kind of way and swallow a large,
      imaginary mass of something. I asked Lorenzo why he felt so depressed, and
      he said: "William, I have came here for a favor." He always said "I have
      came," for he was a self-made man and hadn't done a very good job either.
      "I have came here for a favor. I wrote a reply to your venomous attack of
      to-day and I expected to publish it to-morrow in my paper, but, to tell
      you the truth, we are out of paper. At least, we have a few bundles at the
      freight office, but they have taken to sending it C. O. D., and I haven't
      the means just at hand to take it out. Now, as a brother in the great and
      glorious order of journalism, would it be too much for you to loan me a
      couple of bundles of paper to do me till I get my pay for some equestrian
      bills struck off Friday and just as good as the wheat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long would a couple of bundles last you?" I asked as I looked out at
      the window and wondered if he would reveal his circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five issues and a little over," he said, filling his pipe from a small
      box on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you could cut off your exchanges and then it would last longer," I
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but only for one additional issue. I am very anxious to appear
      to-morrow, because my subscribers will be looking for a reply to what you
      said about me this morning. You stated that I was 'a journalistic bacteria
      looking for something to infect,' and while I did not come here to get you
      to retract, I would like it as a favor if you would loan me enough white
      paper to set myself straight before my subscribers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why don't you go and tell them about it? It wouldn't take long," I
      said in a jocund way, slapping Lorenzo on the back. But he did not laugh.
      I then told him that we only had paper enough to last us till our next
      bill came, and so I could not possibly loan any, but that if he would
      write a caustic reply to my editorial I would print it for him. He caught
      me in his arms and then for a moment his head was pillowed on my breast.
      Then he sat down and wrote the following card:
    </p>
    <p>
      Editor of the Boomerang:
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you allow me through your columns to state that in your issue of
      yesterday you did me a great injustice by referring to me as a
      journalistic bacteria looking for something to infect; also, as a lop
      eared germ of contagion, and warning people to vaccinate in order to
      prevent my spread? I denounce the whole article as a malicious falsehood,
      and state that if you will only give me a chance I will fight you on
      sight. All I ask is that you will wait till I can overtake you, and I am
      able and willing to knock great chunks off the universe with you. I do not
      ask any favors of an editor who misleads his subscribers and intentionally
      misunderstands his correspondents; a man who advises an anxious inquirer
      who wants to know "how to get a cheap baby buggy" to leave the child at a
      cheap hotel; a man who assumes to wear brains, but who really thinks with
      a fungus growth; a man the bleak and barren exterior of whose head is only
      equalled by its bald and echoing interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorenzo Dow Pease.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked it over, and as there didn't seem to be anything personal in it,
      I told him I would print it for him with pleasure. He then asked that I
      would, as a further favor, refrain from putting any advertising marks on
      it and that I would make it follow pure reading matter, which I did. I
      leaded the card and printed it with a simple word of introduction, in
      which I said that I took pleasure in printing it, inasmuch as Mr. Pease
      could not get his paper out of the express office for a few days. It was a
      kindness to him and did not hurt my paper in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many reasons why the establishment of a department of journalism
      at Cornell will be a good move, and I believe that while it will not take
      the place of actual experience, it will serve to shorten the
      apprenticeship of a young newspaper man and the fatigue of starting the
      amateur in journalism will be divided between the managing editor and the
      tutor. It will also give the aspiring sons of wealthy parents a chance to
      toy with journalism without interfering with those who are actually
      engaged in it.

    <h2>
      HIS GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> ALWAYS enjoy a
      vegetable garden, and through the winter I look forward to the spring days
      when I will take my cob pipe and hoe and go joyously afield. I like to toy
      with the moist earth and the common squash bug of the work-a-day world. It
      is a pleasure also to irrigate the garden, watering the sauer kraut plant
      and the timid tomato vine as though they were children asking for a drink.
      I am never happier than when I am engaged in irrigating my tropical garden
      or climbing my neighbor with a hoe when he shuts off my water supply by
      sticking an old pair of pantaloons in the canal that leads to my squash
      conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a man shut off my irrigation that way and dammed the water up to
      such a degree that I shut off his air supply, and I was about to say
      dammed him up also. We had quite a scuffle. Up to that time we had never
      exchanged a harsh word. That morning I noticed that my early climbing
      horse-radish and my dwarf army worms were looking a little au revoir, and
      I wondered what was the matter. I had been absent several days and was
      grieved to notice that my garden had a kind of blase air, as though it
      needed rest and change of scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Poland China egg-plant looked up sadly at me and seemed to say:
      "Pardner, don't you think it's a long time between drinks?" The watermelon
      seemed to have a dark brown taste in its mouth, and there was an air of
      gloom all over the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment I discovered my next-door neighbor at the ditch on the
      corner. He was singing softly to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      O, yes, I'll meet you;
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll meet you when the sun goes down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also jamming an old pair of Rembrandt pants into the canal, where
      they would shut off my supply. He stood with his back towards me, and just
      as he said he would "meet me when the sun went down," I smote him across
      the back of the neck with my hoe handle, and before he could recover from
      the first dumb surprise and wonder, I pulled the dripping pantaloons out
      of the ditch and tied them in a true-lover's knot around his neck. He
      began to look black in the face, and his struggles soon ceased altogether.
      At that moment his wife came out and shrieked two pure womanly shrieks,
      and hissed in my ear: "You have killed me husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, possibly I had. If so, would she please send in the bill and I
      would adjust it at an early day. I said this in a bantering tone of voice,
      and raising my hat to her in that polished way of mine, started to go,
      when something fell with a thud on the greensward!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the author of these lines. I did not know till two days afterward
      that my neighbor's wife wore a moire antique rolling-pin under her apron
      that morning. I did not suspect it till it was too late. The affair was
      kind of hushed up on account of the respectability of the parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time I had recovered the garden seemed to melt away into thin air.
      My neighbor had it all his own way, and while his proud hollyhocks and
      Johnny-jump-ups reared their heads to drink the mountain water at the
      twilight hour, my little, low-necked, summer squashes curled up and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most every year yet I made a garden. I pay a man $3 to plow it. Then I pay
      $7.50 for garden seeds and in July I hire the same man at $3 to
      summer-fallow the whole thing while I go and buy my vegetables of a
      Chinaman named Wun Lung. I've done this now for eight years, and I owe my
      robust health and rich olive complexion to the fact that I've got a garden
      and do just as little in it as possible. Parties desiring a dozen or more
      of my Shanghai egg-plants to set under an ordinary domestic hen can
      procure the same by writing to me and enclosing lock of hair and $10.

      last issue of the <i>Retina</i>, your new thought vehicle, published at
      New Belony, this state, was received yesterday. I like this number, I
      think, better than I did the first. While the news in it seems fresher,
      the editorial assertions are not so fresh. You do not state that you "have
      come to stay" this week, but I infer that you occupy the same position you
      did last week with inference to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was more especially interested in your piece about how to rear children
      and the care of parents. I read it to your mother last night while she was
      setting her bread. Nothing tickles me very often at my time of life, and
      when I laugh a loud peal of laughter at anything nowadays it's got to be a
      pretty blamed good thing, I can tell you that. But your piece about
      bringing up children made me laugh real hard. I enjoy a piece like that
      from the pen of a juicy young brain like yours. It almost made me young
      again to read the words of my journalistic gosling son.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also say that "teething is the most trying time for parents." Do you
      mean that parents are more fretful when they are teething than any other
      time? Your mother and me reckoned that you must mean that. If so, it shows
      your great research. How a mere child hardly out of knee-panties, a young
      shoot like you, who was never a parent for a moment in his life, can enter
      into and understand the woes that beset parents is more than I can
      understand. If you had been through what I have while teething I could see
      how you might understand and write about it, but at present I do not see
      through it. The first teeth I cut as a parent made me very restless. I was
      sick two years ago with a new disease that was just out and the doctor
      gave me something for it that made my teeth fall like the leaves of
      autumn. In six weeks after I began to convalesce my mouth was perfectly
      bald-headed. For days I didn't bite into a Ben Davis apple that I didn't
      leave a fang into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, after that I saw an advertisement in the <i>Rural Rustler</i>&mdash;a
      paper I used to take then&mdash;of a place where you could get a set of
      teeth for $6.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't want to buy a high-priced and gaudy set of teeth at the tail end
      of such a life as I had led, and I knew that teeth, no matter how
      expensive they might be, would be of little avail to coming generations,
      so I went over to the place named in the paper and got an impression of my
      mouth taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is really nothing in this life that will take the stiff-necked pride
      out of a man like viewing a plaster cast of his tottering mouth. The
      dentist fed me with a large ladle full of putty or plaster of paris, I
      reckon, and told me to hold it in my mouth till it set.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't remember a time in all my life when the earth and transitory
      things ever looked so undesirable and so trifling as they did while I sat
      there in that big red barber-chair with my mouth full of cold putty. I
      felt just as a man might when he is being taxidermied.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awhile the dentist took out the cast. It was a cloudy day and so it
      didn't look much like me after all. If it had I would have sent you one.
      After I'd set again two or three times, we got a pretty fair likeness, he
      said, and I went home, having paid $6 and left my address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks after that a small boy came with my new teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were nice, white, shiny teeth, and did not look very ghastly after I
      had become used to them. I wished at first that the gums had been a duller
      red and that the teeth had not looked so new. I put them in my mouth, but
      they felt cold and distant. I took them out and warmed them in the
      sunlight. People going by no doubt thought that I did it to show that I
      was able to have new teeth, but that was not the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wore them all that forenoon while I butchered. There were times during
      the forenoon when I wanted to take them out, but when a man is butchering
      he hates to take his teeth out just because they hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neighbors told me that after my mouth got hardened on the inside it would
      feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, oh, how it relieved me at night to take those teeth out and put them
      on the top of a cool bureau, where the wind could blow through their
      whiskers! How I hated to resume them in the morning and start in on
      another long day, when the roof of my mouth felt like a big, red bunion
      and my gums like a pale red stone-bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago, Henry, about two-thirty in the afternoon I think it was, I
      left that set of teeth in the rare flank of a barbecue I was to in our
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then I have not been so pretty, perhaps, but I have no more unicorns
      on the rafters of my mouth and my note is just as good at thirty days as
      ever it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are right, Henry, when you go on to state in your paper that teething
      is the most trying time for parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ta, ta, as the feller says.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your father.

      ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      George E. Beath, Areola, Ill.,-writes to know "the value of a silver
      dollar of 1878 with eight feathers in the eagle's tail."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth what you can get for it, Mr. Beath. Perhaps the better way
      would be to forward it to me and I will do the best I can with it. There
      being but eight feathers in the eagle's tail would be no drawback. Send it
      to me at once and I will work it off for you, Mr. Beath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tutor," Tucson, Ariz., asks "What do you regard as the best method of
      teaching the alphabet to children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Very likely my method would hardly receive your indorsement, but with my
      own children I succeed by using an alphabet with the names attached, which
      I give below. I find that by connecting the alphabet with certain easy and
      interesting subjects the child rapidly acquires knowledge of the letter,
      and it becomes firmly fixed in the mind. I use the following list of
      alphabetical names in the order given below:
    </p>
    <p>
      A is for Antediluvian, Anarchistic and Agamemnon.
    </p>
    <p>
      B is for Bucephalus, Burgundy and Bull-head. C is for Cantharides,
      Confucius and Casabianca. D is for Deuteronomy, Delphi and Dishabille.
    </p>
    <p>
      E is for Euripedes, European and Effervescent. F is for Fumigate,
      Farinaceous and Fundamental.
    </p>
    <p>
      G is for Garrulous, Gastric and Gangrene.
    </p>
    <p>
      H is for Hamestrap, Honeysuckle and Hoyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I is for Idiosyncrasy, Idiomatic and Iodine.
    </p>
    <p>
      J is for Jaundice, Jamaica and Jeu-d'esprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      K is for Kandilphi, Kindergarten and KuKlux. L is for Lop-sided, Lazarus
      and Llano Estacado. M is for Menengitis, Mardi Gras and Mesopotamia.
    </p>
    <p>
      N is for Narragansett, Neapolitan and Nix-comarous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q is for Oleander, Oleaginous and Oleomargarine.
    </p>
    <p>
      P is for Phlebotomy, Phthisic and Parabola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q is for Query, Quasi and Quits.
    </p>
    <p>
      R is for Rejuvenate, Regina and Requiescat.
    </p>
    <p>
      S is for Simultaneous, Sigauche and Saleratus.
    </p>
    <p>
      T is for Tubercular, Themistocles and Thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      U is for Ultramarine, Uninitiated and Utopian.
    </p>
    <p>
      V is for Voluminous, Voltaire and Vivisection. W is for Witherspoon,
      Woodcraft and Washerwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      X is for Xenophon, Xerxes and Xmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Y is for Ysdle, Yahoo and Yellowjacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Z is for Zoological, Zanzibar and Zacatecas.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the eye of the child is first appealed to. He becomes familiar
      with the words which begin with a certain letter, and before he knows it
      the letter itself has impressed itself upon his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, however, where my children were slow to remember a word and
      hence its corresponding letter, I have drawn the object on a blackboard or
      on the side of the barn. For instance, we will suppose that D is hard to
      fix in the mind of the pupil and the words to which it belongs as an
      initial do not readily cling to memory. I have only to draw upon the board
      a Deuteronomy, a Delphi, or a Dishabille, and he will never forget it. No
      matter how he may struggle to do so, it will still continue to haunt his
      brain forever. The same with Z, which is a very difficult letter to
      remember. I assist the memory by stimulating the eye, drawing rapidly, and
      crudely perhaps, a Zoological, a Zanzibar or a Zacatecas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great difficulty in teaching children the letters is that there is
      really nothing in the naked alphabet itself to win a child's love. We must
      dress it in attractive colors and gaudy plumage so that he will be
      involuntarily drawn to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have used my method say that after mastering the alphabet, the
      binomial theorum and the rule in Shelly's case seemed like child's play.
      This goes to show what method and discipline will accomplish in the mind
      of the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fond Mother," Braley's Fork, asks: "What shall I name my little girl
      baby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That will depend upon yourself very largely, "Fond Mother." Very likely if
      your little girl is very rugged and grows up to be the fat woman in a
      museum, she will wear the name of Lily. When a girl is named Lily, she at
      once manifests a strong desire to grow up with a complexion like Othello
      and the same fatal yearning for some one to strangle. This is not always
      thus, but girls are obstinate, and it is better not to put a name on a
      girl baby that she will not live up to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, "Fond Mother," let me urge you to refrain from naming your little
      daughter a soft, flabby name like Irma, Geraldine, Bandoline, Lilelia,
      Potassa, Valerian, Rosetta or Castoria. These names belong to the
      inflammatory pages of the American novelette. Do not put such a name on
      your innocent child. Imagine this inscription on a marble slab:
    </p>
    <h3>
      TRIFOLIATA,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      BELOVED DAUGHTER OF
    </h3>
    <h3>
      GERALD AND VASELINE TUBBS,
    </h3>
    <h3>
      DIED MARCH 27,1888.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      SHE CAUGHT COLD IN HER FRONT NAME.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have seen a young lady try faithfully for years to live down one of
      these flimsy, cheesecloth names, but the harsh world would not have it. A
      good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and while I can
      imagine your little girl in future years as a white-haired and lovely
      grandmother, wearing the name of Mary or Ruth, with a double chin that
      seems to ever beckon the old gentleman to come and chuck his fat
      forefinger under it, I cannot, in my mind's eye, see her as a household
      deity, wearing a white cap and the name of Rosette or Penumbra, or
      Sogodontia, or Catalpa, or Voxliumania.

    <h2>
      THE FARMER AND THE TARIFF.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N BOARD a western
      train the other day I held in my bosom for over seventy-five miles the
      elbow of a large man whose name I do not know. He was not a railroad hog
      or I would have resented it. He was built wide and he couldn't help it, so
      I forgave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a large, gentle, kindly eye, and when he desired to spit he went to
      the car door, opened it and decorated the entire outside of the train,
      forgetting that our speed would help to give scope to his remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, as he sat there by my side, holding on tightly to his ticket
      and evidently afraid the conductor would forget to come and get it, I
      began to figure out in my mind what might be his business. He had pounded
      one thumb so that the nail was black where the blood had settled under it.
      This might happen to a shoemaker, a carpenter, a blacksmith, or almost any
      one else. So it didn't help me out much, though it looked to me as though
      it might have been done by trying to drive a fence-nail through a leather
      hinge with the back of an ax, and nobody but a farmer would try to do
      that. Following up the clew, I discovered that he had milk on his boots,
      and then I knew I was right. The man who milks before daylight in a dark
      barn when the thermometer is 28 below zero, and who hits his boots by
      reason of the uncertain light and prudishness of the cow, is a marked man.
      He cannot conceal the fact that he is a farmer unless he removes that
      badge. So I started out on that theory, and remarked that this would pass
      for a pretty hard winter on stock. The thought was not original with me,
      for I have heard it expressed by others either in this country or Europe.
      He said it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cattle has gone through a mowful o' hay sence October and eleven ton
      o' brand. Hay don't seem to have the goodness to it thet it hed last year,
      and with their new process griss mills they jerk all the juice out o'
      brand, so's you might as well feed cows with excelsior and upholster your
      horses with hemlock bark as to buy brand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why do you run so much to stock? Why don't you try diversified
      farming and rotation of crops?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, prob'ly you got that idee in the papers. A man that earns big wages
      writing 'Farm Hints' for agricultural papers can make more money with a
      soft lead-pencil and two or three season-cracked idees like that 'n I can
      carrying of 'em out on the farm. We used to have a feller in the
      drug-store in our town that wrote such good pieces for the <i>Rural
      Vermonter</i>, and made up such a good condition powder out of his own
      head that two years ago we asked him to write a nessay for the annual
      meeting of the Buckwheat Trust, and to use his own judgment about choice
      of subject. And what do you s'pose he had selected for a nessey that took
      the whole forenoon to read?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What subject, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he'd wrote out that whole blamed intellectual wad on the subject of
      'The Inhumanity of Dehorning Hydraulic Rams.' How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's pretty fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, farmin' is like runnin' a paper in regard to some things. Every
      feller in the world will take and turn in and tell you how to do it, even
      if he don't know a blame thing about it. There ain't a man in the United
      States to-day that don't secretly think he could run airy one if his other
      business busted on him, whether he knows the difference between a new
      milch cow or a horse hayrake or not. We had one of these embroidered
      nightshirt farmers come from town better'n three years ago. Been a
      toilet-soap man and done well, and so he came out and bought a farm that
      had nothing to it but a fancy house and barn, a lot of medder in the front
      yard, and a Southern aspect. The farm was no good. You couldn't raise a
      disturbance on it. Well, what does he do? Goes and gits a passle of
      slim-tailed yeller cows from New Jersey and aims to handle cream and
      diversified farming. Last year the cuss sent a load of cream over and
      tried to sell it at the new crematory while the funeral and hollercost was
      goin' on. I may be a sort of a chump myself, but I read my paper and don't
      get left like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are the prospects for farmers in your State?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they are pore. Never was so pore, in fact, sence I've ben there.
      Folks wonder why boys leaves the farm. My boys left so as to get
      protected, they said, and so they went into a clothing store, one of 'em,
      and one went into hardware, and one is talkin' protection in the
      Legislature this winter. They said that farmin' was gettin' to be like
      fishin' and huntin', well enough for a man that has means and leisure, but
      they couldn't make a livin' at it, they said. Another boy is in a drug
      store, and the man that hires him says he is a royal feller."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind of a castor royal feller," I said, with a shriek of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until I had laughed all I wanted to, and then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've always hollered for high tariff in order to hyst the public debt,
      but now that we've got the National debt coopered I wish they'd take a
      little hack at mine. I've put in fifty years farmin'. I never drank licker
      in any form. I've worked from ten to eighteen hours a day; been economical
      in cloz and never went to a show more'n a dozen times in my life; raised a
      family and learned upwards of two hundred calves to drink out of a tin
      pail without blowing their vittles up my sleeve. My wife worked alongside
      o' me sewin' new seats on the boys' pants, skim-min' milk, and even
      helpin' me load hay. For forty years we toiled along together and hardly
      got time to look into each other's faces or dared to stop and get
      acquainted with each other. Then her health failed. Ketched cold in the
      springhouse, prob'ly skimmin' milk, and wash-in' pans, and scaldin' pails,
      and spankin' butter. Anyhow, she took in a long breath one day while the
      doctor and me was watchin' her, and she says to me, 'Henry,' says she,
      'I've got a chance to rest,' and she put one tired, wore-out hand on top
      of the other tired, wore-out hand, and I knew she'd gone where they don't
      work all day and do chores all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took time to kiss her then. I'd been too busy for a good while previous
      to do that, and then I called in the boys. After the funeral it was too
      much for them to stay around and eat the kind of cookin' we had to put up
      with, and nobody spoke up around the house as we used to. The boys quit
      whistlin' around the barn, and talked kind of low to themselves about
      goin' to town and getting a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're all gone now, and the snow is four feet deep up there on mother's
      grave in the old berryin'-ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then both of us looked out of the car-window quite a long while without
      saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't blame the boys for going into something else long's other things
      pays better; but I say&mdash;and I say what I know&mdash;that the man who
      holds the prosperity of this country in his hands, the man that actually
      makes the money for other people to spend, the man that eats three good,
      simple, square meals a day and goes to bed at 9 o'clock so that future
      generations with good blood and cool brains can go from his farm to the
      Senate and Congress and the White House&mdash;he is the man that gets left
      at last to run his farm, with nobody to help him but a hired man and a
      high protective tariff. The farms in our State is mortgaged for over
      $700,000,000. Ten of our Western States&mdash;I see by the papers&mdash;has
      got about three billion and a half mortgages on their farms, and that
      don't count the chattel mortgages filed with the town clerks on farm
      machinery, stock, waggins, and even crops, by gosh! that ain't two inches
      high under the snow. That's what the prospect is for farms now. The
      Government is rich, but the men that made it, the men that fought perarie
      fires and perarie wolves and Injins and potato bugs and blizzards, and has
      paid the war debt and pensions and everything else, and hollored for the
      Union and the Republican party and high tariff and anything else that they
      was told to, is left high and dry this cold winter with a mortgage of
      seven billions and a half on the farms they have earned and saved a
      thousand times over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but look at the glory of sending from the farm the future President,
      the future Senator and the future member of Congress."

      "That looks well on paper; but what does it really amount to? Soon as a
      farmer boy gits in a place like that he forgets the soil that produced and
      holds his head as high as a hollyhock. He bellers for protection to
      everybody but the farmer, and while he sails round in a highty-tighty room
      with a fire in it night and day, his father on the farm has to kindle his
      own fire in the morning with elm slivers, and he has to wear his son's
      lawn-tennis suit next to him or freeze to death, and he has to milk in an
      old gray shawl that has held that member of Congress since he was a baby,
      by gorry! and the old lady has to sojourn through the winter in the
      flannels that Silas wor at the rigatter before he went to Congress.
    </p>

      "So I say, and I think that Congress agrees with me, Damn a farmer,
      anyhow!"

    <h2>
      A CONVENTIONAL SPEECH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>URING the recent
      conventions a great many good speeches have been made which did not get
      into print for various reasons. Some others did not even get a hearing and
      still others were prepared by delegates who could not get the eye of the
      presiding officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manuscript of the following speech bears the marks of earnest thought,
      and though the author did not obtain recognition on the floor of the
      convention I cannot bear to see an appreciative public deprived of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention: We are met together here as
      a representation of the greatest and grandest party in the world&mdash;a
      party that has been first in peace, first in war and first in the hearts
      of its countrymen, as the good book has it. We come together here to-day,
      Gentlemen, to perpetuate by our action the principles which won us victory
      at the polls and wrenched it from an irritated and disagreeable foe on
      many a tented field. I refer to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our party has ever been the champion of freedom. We have made a specialty
      of freedom. We have ever been in the van. That's why we have been on the
      move. Where freedom a quarter of a century ago was but a mere name, now we
      have fostered it and aided it and encouraged it and made it pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have emancipated a whole race, several of whom have since voted the
      other way. But we must not be discouraged. We are here to work. Let us do
      it and so advance our common cause and honor God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who is to be the leader? Who will be able to carry our victorious
      banner from Portland, Me., to Portland, Ore., gayly speaking pieces from
      the tail-gate of a train? Who is sufficiently obscure to safely make the
      race? (Cries of "Jeremiah M. Rusk," "Rudolph Minkins Pitler," "Blaine,"
      "James Swartout," "John Sherman," "Charlie Kinney," &amp;c.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye of the nation is upon us. We cannot escape the awful
      responsibility which we have to-day assumed. With all our anxiety to
      please our friends we must not forget that we are here in the interests of
      universal freedom. Do not allow yourselves to be blinded, gentlemen, by
      the assurance that this is to be a businessman's campaign, a campaign in
      which conflicting business interests are to figure more than the late war.
      It is a fight involving universal freedom, as I said in our conventions
      four, eight and twelve years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have before us a pure and highly elocutionary platform. Let us nominate
      a man who will, as I may say, affilliate and amalgamate with that
      platform. Who is that man? (Cries of "Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine,"
      "Lockwood, Lockwood, Belva A. Lockwood," and general confusion, during
      which John A. Wise is seen to jerk loose about a nickel's worth of Billy
      Mahone's whiskers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the convention, there has never been a more
      harmonious convention in the United States to my knowledge since the Sioux
      massacre in Minnesota. We are all here for the best good of the party and
      each is willing to concede something rather than create any ill-feeling.
      Look at Mahone for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a good platform, now let us nominate a man whose record is in
      harmony with that platform. Freedom has ever been our watchword. Now that
      we have made the human race within our borders absolutely free, let us add
      to our magnificent history as a party by one crowning act. Let us fight
      for the Emancipation of Rum!
    </p>
    <p>
      Rum has always been a mighty power in American politics, but it has not
      been absolutely free. Let us be the first to recognize it as the great
      corner-stone of American institutions. Let us make it free.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have never had any Daniel Websters or Henry Clays since rum went up
      from 20 cents a gallon to its present price. The war tax on whiskey for
      over twenty years has made freedom a farce and liberty a loud and empty
      snort in mid-air. 'Who, then, shall be our standard-bearer as we journey
      onward towards victory? (Cries of "Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine," and
      confusion.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen, I wish that a better and thrillinger orator had been selected
      in my place to name the candidate on whom alone I can unite. Soldiers,
      rail-splitters, statesmen, canal boys, tailors, farmers, merchants and
      school teachers have been Presidents of the United States, but to my
      knowledge no convention has ever yet named a distiller. I have the honor
      to-day to name a modest man for the high office of President; a man who
      never before allowed his name to be presented to a convention; a man who
      never even stated in the papers that his name would not be presented to
      the convention; a man who has never sought or courted publicity even in
      his own business; a man who has been a distiller in a quiet way for over
      fifteen years and yet has never even advertised in the papers; a man who
      has so carefully shunned the eye of the world that only two or three of us
      know where his place of business is; a man who has such an utter contempt
      for office that he has shot two Government officials who claimed to be
      connected with the internal revenue business; a man who can drink or let
      it alone, but who has aimed to divide the time up about equally between
      the two; a man who had absolutely nothing to do with the war, not having
      heard about it in time; a man who defies his culumniators or anybody else
      of his heft; a man who would paint the White House red; a man who takes
      great pleasure in being his own worst enemy. (Cries of "Name him! Name
      him!" Great confusion, and cries of pain from several harmonious delegates
      who are getting the worst of it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to take up your time, let me say in closing that the day for great men
      as candidates for an important office is past. Great men in a great
      country antagonize different factions and are then compelled to fall back
      on literature. What we want is an obscure and silent chump. I have found
      him. He has never antagonized but two men in his life and they are now
      voting in a better land. He is a plain man, and his career at Washington
      would be marked with more or less tobacco juice. For over fifteen years he
      has been constructing at his country seat a lurid style of whiskey known
      as The Essence of Crime. Quietly and unostentatiously he has fought for
      the emancipation of whiskey everywhere. He says that we are too prone to
      worry about our clothes and their cost and to give too little thought to
      our tax-ridden rum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, here in the full glare of public
      approval, feeling that the name I am about to pronounce will in a few
      moments flash across a mighty continent and greet the moist and moaning
      news editor, the grimy peasant, the pussy banker and the streaked tennis
      player; that the name I now nourish in my panting brain will soon be taken
      up on willing tongues and borne across the union, rising and saluting the
      hot blue dome of heaven, pulsating across the ocean, rocking the
      beautifully upholstered thrones of the Old World and calling forth a dark
      blue torrent of profanity from the offices of the illustrated papers, none
      of which will be provided with his portrait, I desire to name Mr. Clem
      Beasly, of Arkansaw, a man who has spent his best years manufacturing
      man's greatest enemy. I hurrah for him and holler for him, and love him
      for the (hic) enemy he has made.

    <h2>
      A PLEA FOR ONE IN ADVERSITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> LEARN with much
      sadness that Mr. William H. Vanderbilt's once princely fortune has
      shrivelled down to $150,000,000. This piece of information comes to me
      like a clap of thunder out of a clear sky. Once petted, fondled and
      caressed, William H. Vanderbilt shorn of his wealth, and resting upon no
      foundation but his sterling integrity, must struggle along with the rest
      of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be but truth to say that Mr. Vanderbilt will receive very little
      sympathy from the world now in the days of his adversity and penury when
      the wolf is at his door. There are many of his former friends who will say
      that William could economize and struggle along on $150,000,000, but let
      them try it once and see how they would like it themselves; $150,000,000,
      with no salary outside of that amount, will not last forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor man might pinch along in such a case if he could get something to
      do, but we must remember that Mr. Vanderbilt has always lived in
      comparatively comfortable circumstances. His hands, therefore, are tender
      and his stomach juts out into the autumn air. He will, therefore, find it
      hard at first to husk corn and dig potatoes. When he stoops over a sawbuck
      around New York this winter his stomach will be in the way and his vest
      will no doubt split open on the back. All these things will annoy the
      spoiled child of luxury, and his broad features will be covered with
      sadness. They will, at least, if there is sadness enough in the country to
      do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fall of William 'H. Vanderbilt and his headlong plunge from the proud
      eminence to which his means had elevated him downward to the cringing
      poverty of $150,000,000 should be a sad warning to us all. This fate may
      fall to any of us. Oh, let us be prepared when the summons comes. For one
      I believe I am ready. Should the dread news come to me to-morrow that such
      a fate had befallen me, I would nerve myself up to it and meet it like a
      man. With the ruin of my former fortune I would buy me a crust of bread
      and some pie, and then I would take the balance and go over into Canada
      and there I would establish a home for friendless bank cashiers who are
      now there, several hundred of them, all alone and with no one to love
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All kinds of charitable institutions, costing many thousands of dollars,
      are built in America from year to year for the comfort of homeless and
      friendless women and children, but man is left out in the cold. Why is
      this thus. Lots of people in Canada, of course, are doing their best to
      make it cheerful and sunny for our lovely cashiers there, but still it is
      not home. As a gentleman once said in my hearing, "There is no place like
      home." And he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, I do not know what to say, unless it be to appeal to the
      newspaper men of the country in Mr. Vanderbilt's behalf. While he was
      wealthy he was proud and arrogant. He said, "Let the newspapers be
      blankety blanked to blank," or words to that effect, but we do not care
      for that. Let us forget all that and remember that his sad fate may some
      day be our own. In our affluence let us not lose sight of the fact that
      Van is suffering. Let us procure a place for him on some good paper. His
      grammar and spelling are a little bit rickety but he could begin as
      janitor and gradually work his way up. Parties having clothing or funds
      which they feel like giving may forward the same to me at Hudson, Wis.,
      postpaid, and if the clothes do not fit Van they may possibly fit me.
    </p>
    <p>
      New York, Oct. 7,1883.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Nye.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S,&mdash;Oct. 30.&mdash;Since issuing the above I have received several
      consignments of clothes for the suffering, also one sack of corn-meal and
      a ham. Let the good work go on, for it is far more blessed to give than to
      receive, I am told; and as Jay Gould said when, as a boy, he gave the
      wormy half of an apple to his dear teacher, "Half is better than the
      hole."

    <h2>
      THE RHUBARB-PIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N June the
      medicated tropical fruit known as the rhubarb-pie is in full bloom. The
      farmer goes forth into his garden to find out where the coy, old setting
      hen is hiding from the vulgar gaze, and he discovers that his pie-plant is
      ripe. He then forms a syndicate with his wife for the purpose of
      publishing the seditious and rebellious pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is singular that the War Department has never looked into the scheme
      for fighting the Indians with rhubarb-pie, instead of the regular army.
      One-half the army could then put in its time court-martialing the other
      half, and all would be well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhubarb undoubtedly has its place in the <i>materia medica</i>, but when
      it sneaks into the pie of commerce it is out of place. Castor-oil, and
      capsicum, and dynamite, and chloroform, and porous-plasters, and arsenic,
      all have their uses in one way or another, but they would not presume to
      enter into the composition of a pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They know it would not be tolerated. But rhubarb, elated with its success
      as a drug, forgets its humble origin and aspires to become au article of
      diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the pumpkin knows its place. You never knew of a pumpkin trying to
      monkey with science. The pumpkin knows that it was born to bury itself in
      the bosom of the pumpkin-pie. It does not therefore, go about the country
      claiming to be a remedy for spavin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposing that the gory, yet toothsome steak, that grows on the back of
      the twenty-one-year-old steer's neck, should claim for itself that it
      could go into a drug-store and cure rheumatism and heartburn. Wouldn't
      every one say that it was out of place and uncalled for? Certainly. The
      back of the tough old steer's neck knows that it is destined for the
      mince-pie, and nature did not intend otherwise. So also with the
      vulcanized gristle, and arctic overshoe heel, and the shoe-string, and the
      white button, and all those elements that go to make up the mince-pie.
      They do not try to make medicines and cordials and anodynes of themselves.
      Rhubarb is the only thing that successfully holds its place with the
      apothecary, and yet draws a salary in the pie business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how others may look at this matter, but I do not think it is
      right. Still you find this medicated pie in the social circle everywhere.
      We guard our homes with the strictest surveillance in other matters, and
      yet we allow the low, vulgar pie-plant-pie to creep into our houses and
      into our hearts. That is, it creeps into our hearts figuratively speaking.
      The heart is not, as a matter of fact, one of the digestive organs, but I
      use the term just as all poets do under like circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, however, will always continue to use the rhubarb-pie, and for those
      I give below a receipt which has stood the test of years,&mdash;one which
      results in a pie that frosts and sudden atmospheric changes cannot injure.
    </p>
    <p>
      None but the youngest rhubarb should be used in making pies. Go out and
      kill your rhubarb with a club, taking care not to kill the old and tough
      variety. Give it a chance to repent. Remove the skin carefully, and take
      out the digestive economy of the plant. Be specially careful to get off
      the "fuzzy" coating, as rhubarb-pies with hair on are not in such favor as
      they were when the country was new. Now put in the basement of cement and
      throw on your rhubarb. Flavor with linseed-oil, and hammer out the top
      crust until it is moderately thin. Then solder on the cover and drill
      holes for the copper rivets. Having headed the rivets in place, nail on
      zinc monogram, and kiln-dry the pie slowly. When it is cooled, put on two
      coats of metallic paint, and adjust the time-lock. After you find that the
      pie is impervious to the action of chilled steel or acids, remove and feed
      it to the man who cheerfully pays for his whiskey and steals his
      newspaper.

    <h2>
      A COUNTRY FIRE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>AST night I was
      awakened by the cry of fire. It was a loud, hoarse cry, such as a large,
      adult man might emit from his window on the night air. The town was not
      large, and the fire-department, I had been told, was not so effective as
      it should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that reason I arose and carefully dressed myself in order to assist,
      if possible. I carefully lowered myself from my room by means of a
      staircase which I found concealed in a dark and mysterious corner of the
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the streets all was confusion. The hoarse cry of fire had been taken up
      by others, passed around from one to another, till it had swollen into a
      dull roar. The cry of fire in a small town is always a grand sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All along the street in front of Mr. Pendergast's roller rink the blanched
      faces of the people could be seen. Men were hurrying to and fro, knocking
      the by-standers over in their frantic attempts to get somewhere else. With
      great foresight Mr. Pendergast, who had that day finished painting his
      roller rink a dull-roan color, removed from the building the large card
      which bore the legend
    </p>
    <h3>
      FRESH PAINT!
    </h3>
    <p>
      so that those who were so disposed might feel perfectly free to lean up
      against the rink and watch the progress of the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon the bright glare of the devouring element might have been seen
      bursting through the casement of Mr. Cicero Williams' residence, facing on
      the alley west of Mr. Pendergast's rink. Across the street the spectator
      whose early education had not been neglected could distinctly read the
      sign of our esteemed fellow-townsman, Mr. Alonzo Burlingame, which was lit
      up by the red glare of the flames so that the letters stood out plain as
      follows:
    </p>
    <h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      The flames spread rapidly, until they threat ened the Palace rink of our
      esteemed fellow-townsman, Mr. Pendergast, whose genial and urbane manner
      has endeared him to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a degree of forethought worthy of a better cause, Mr. Leroy W. Butts
      suggested the propriety of calling out the hook and ladder company, an
      organization of which every one seemed to be justly proud. Some delay
      ensued in trying to find the janitor of Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company
      No. 1's building, but at last he was secured, and after he had gone home
      for the key, Mr. Butts ran swiftly down the street to awake the foreman,
      but after he had dressed himself and inquired anxiously about the fire, he
      said that he was not foreman of the company since the 2d of April.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the fire-fiend continued to rise up ever and anon on his hind
      feet and lick up salt barrel after salt barrel in close proximity to the
      Palace rink, owned by our esteemed fellow-citizen, Mr. Pendergast. Twice
      Mr. Pendergast was seen to shudder, after which he went home and filled
      out a blank which he forwarded to the insurance company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the town seemed doomed the hook-and-ladder company came rushing
      down the street with their navy-blue hook-and-ladder truck. It is indeed a
      beauty, being one of the Excelsior noiseless hook-and-ladder factory's
      best instruments, with tall red pails and rich blue ladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some delay ensued, as several of the officers claimed that under a new
      by-law passed in January they were permitted to ride on the truck to
      fires. This having been objected to by a gentleman who had lived in
      Chicago for several years, a copy of the by-laws was sent for and the
      dispute summarily settled. The company now donned its rubber overcoats
      with great coolness and proceeded at once to deftly twist the tail of the
      fire-fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a thrilling sight as James McDonald, a brother of Terrance
      McDonald, Trombone, Ind., rapidly ascended one of the ladders in the full
      glare of the devouring element and fell off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a wild cheer rose to a height of about nine feet, and all again
      became confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now past 11 o'clock, and several of the members of the
      hook-and-ladder company who had to get up early the next day in order to
      catch a train excused themselves and went home to seek much-needed rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it was discovered that the brick livery stables of Mr.
      McMichaels, a nephew of our worthy assessor, was getting hot. Leaving the
      Palace rink to its fate, the hook-and-ladder company directed its
      attention to the brick barn, and after numerous attempts at last succeeded
      in getting its large iron prong fastened on the second story window-sill,
      which was pulled out. The hook was again inserted but not so effectively,
      bringing down this time an armful of hay and part of an old horse blanket.
      Another courageous jab was made with the iron hook, which succeeded in
      pulling out about five cents' worth of brick. This was greeted by a wild
      burst of applause from the bystanders, during which the hook-and-ladder
      company fell over each other and added to the horror of the scene by a mad
      burst of pale-blue profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before the stable was licked up by the fire-fiend, and the
      hook-and-ladder company directed its attention toward the undertaking,
      embalming, and ice-cream parlors of our highly-esteemed fellow-townsman,
      Mr. A. Burlingame. The company succeeded in pulling two stone window-sills
      out of this building before it burned. Both times they were encored by the
      large and aristocratic audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burlingame at once recognized the efforts of the heroic firemen by
      tapping a keg of beer, which he distributed among them at twenty-five
      cents per glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning a space forty-seven feet wide, where but yesterday all was
      joy and prosperity and beauty, is covered over with blackened ruins. Mr.
      Pendergast is overcome by grief at the loss of his rink, but assures us
      that if he is successful in getting the full amount of his insurance he
      will take the money and build two rinks, either one of which will be far
      more imposing than the one destroyed last evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement is on foot to give a literary and musical entertainment at
      Burley's Hall to raise funds for the purchase of new uniforms for the
      "fire laddies," at which Mrs. Butts has consented to sing "When the Robins
      Nest Again," and Miss Mertie Stout will recite "'Ostler Joe," a selection
      which never fails to offend the best people everywhere. Twenty-five cents
      for each offence. Let there be a full house.

      BIG STEVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU think, no
      doubt, William, that I am happy, but I cannot say that I am. I will tell
      you my little reminiscence if you don't mind, and you can judge for
      yourself." These were the words of Big Steve, as we sat together one
      evening, watching the dealer slide the cards out of his little tin
      photograph album, while the crowd bought chips of the banker and corded
      them up out the green table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look on me as a great man to inaugurate a funeral, and wish that you
      had a miscellaneous cemetery yourself to look back on; but greatness
      always has its drawbacks. We cannot be great unless we pay the price. What
      we call genius is after all only industry and perseverance. When my father
      undertook to clean me out, in our own St. Lawrence County home, I filed
      his coat-tails full of bird-shot and fled. Father afterwards said that he
      could have overlooked it so far as the coat was concerned, but he didn't
      want it shot to pieces while he had it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I went to Kansas City and shot a colored man. That was a good many
      years ago, and you could kill a colored man then as you can a Chinaman
      now, with impunity, or any other weapon you can get your hands onto. Still
      the colored man had friends and I had to go further West. I went to Nevada
      then, and lived under a cloud and a <i>nom de plume</i>, as you fellers
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really didn't want to thin out the population of Nevada, but I had to
      protect myself. They say that after a feller has killed his man, he has a
      thirst for blood and can't stop, but that ain't so. You
      'justifiable-homicide' a man and get clear, and then you have to look out
      for friends of the late lamented. You see them everywhere. If your stomach
      gets out of order you see the air full of vengeance, and you drink too
      much and that don't help it. Then you kill a man on suspicion that he is
      follering you up, and after that you shoot in an extemporaneous, way, that
      makes life in your neighborhood a little uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the way it was with me. I've got where I don't sleep good any
      more, and the fun of life has kind of pinched out, as we say in the mines.
      It's a big thing to run a school-meeting or an election, but it hardly
      pays me for the free spectacular show I see when I'm trying to sleep. You
      know if you've ever killed a man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never killed one right out," I said apologetically. "I shot one
      once, but he gained seventy-five pounds in less than six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ever had, you'd notice that he always says or does something
      that you can remember him by. He either says, 'Oh, I am shot'! or 'You've
      killed me'! or something like that, in a reproachful way, that you can
      wake up in the night and hear most any time. If you kill him dead, and he
      don't say a word, he will fall hard on the ground, with a groan that will
      never stop. I can shut my eyes and hear one now. After you've done it, you
      always wish they'd showed a little more fight. You could forgive 'em if
      they'd cuss you, and holler, and have some style about 'em, but they
      won't. They just reel, and fall, and groan. Do you know I can't eat a meal
      unless my back is agin' the wall. I asked Wild Bill once how he could
      stand it to turn his back on the crowd and eat a big dinner. He said he
      generally got drunk just before dinner, and that helped him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see, William, that if a man is a great scholar, he is generally
      dyspeptic; if he's a big preacher, they tie a scandal to his coat-tail,
      and if he's an eminent murderer, he has insomnia and loss of appetite. I
      almost wish sometimes that I had remained in obscurity. Its a big thing to
      be a public man, with your name in the papers and everybody afraid to
      collect a bill of you, for fear you'll let the glad sunlight into their
      thorax; but when you can't eat nor sleep, and you're liable to wake up
      with your bosom full of buckshot, or your neck pulled out like a
      turkey-gobler's, and your tongue hanging out of your mouth in a ludicrous
      manner, and your overshoes failing to touch the ground by about ten feet,
      you begin to look back on your childhood and wish you could again be put
      there, sleepy and sinless, hungry and happy."

    <h2>
      SPEECH OF RED SHIRT, THE FIGHTING CHIEF OF THE SIOUX NATION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T HAD been a day
      of triumph at Erastina. Buffalo Bill, returning from Marlborough House,
      had amused the populace with the sports of an amphitheatre to an extent
      hitherto unknown even in that luxurious city. A mighty multitude of people
      from Perth Amboy and New York had been present to watch the attack on the
      Dead wood coach and view with bated breath the conflict in the arena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of revelry had died away. The last loiterer had retired from
      the bleaching boards and the lights in the palace of the cowboy band were
      extinguished. The moon piercing the tissue of fleecy clouds, tipped the
      dark waters about Constable Hook with a wavy, tremulous light. The
      dark-browed Roman soldier, wearing an umbrella belonging to Imre Kiralfy,
      wabbled slowly homeward, the proud possessor of a large rectangular "jag."
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound was heard save the low sob of some retiring wave as it told its
      story to the smooth pebbles of the beach, or the lower sob of some
      gentleman who had just sought to bed down a brand-new bucking bronco from
      Ogallalla and decided to escape violently through the roof of the tent;
      then all was still as the breast when the spirit has departed. Anon the
      smoke-tanned Cheyenne snore would steal in upon the silence and then die
      away like the sough of a summer breeze. In the green-room of the
      amphitheatre a little band of warriors had assembled. The foam of conflict
      yet lingered on their lips, the scowl of battle yet hung upon their brows,
      and the large knobs on their classic profiles indicated that it had been a
      busy day with them. The night wynd blew chill and the warrior had added to
      his moss-agate ear-bobs a heavy coat of maroon-colored roof paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an embarrassing silence of a little spell and then Red Shirt,
      fighting chief of the Sioux Nation borrowed a chew of tobacco from
      Aurelius Poor Doe, stepped forth and thus addressed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      Fellow-Citizens and Gentlemen of the Wild West: Ye call me chief, and ye
      do well to call him chief who for two long years has met in the arena
      every shape of man or beast that the broad empire of Nebraska could
      furnish, and yet has never lowered his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be one among you can say that ever at grub dance or scalp german
      or on the war-path my action did belie my tongue let him stand forth and
      say it and I will send him home with his daylights done up in the morning
      paper. If there be three in all your company dare face me on the bloody
      sands let them come on and I will bore holes in the arena with them and
      utilize them in fixing up a sickening spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I was not alway thus, a hired butcher attacking a Deadwood coach,
      both afternoon and evening, the savage chief of still more savage men.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ancestors came from Illinois. They dwelt there in the vine-clad hills
      and citron groves of the Sangamon at a time when the country was overrun
      with Indians. Instead of paying to see Indians, my ancestors would walk a
      long distance over a poor road in order to get a shot at a white man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Dakota my early life ran quiet as the clear brook by which I babbled,
      and my boyhood was one long, happy summer day. We bathed in the soiled
      waters of the upper Missouri and ate the luscious prickly pear in the land
      of the Dakotahs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not then know what war was, but when Sitting Bull told me of
      Marathon and Leuctra and Bull Run, and how at a fortified railroad pass
      Imre Kiralfy had withstood the whole Roman army, my cheek burned, I knew
      not why, and I thought what a glorious thing it would be to leave the
      reservation and go upon the warpath. But my mother kissed my throbbing
      temples and bade me go soak my head and think no more of those old tales
      and savage wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very night the entire regular army and wife landed on our coasts.
      They tore down our tepee, stampeded our stock, stole our grease paints and
      played a mean trick on our dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day in the arena I killed a man in the Black Hills coach, and when I
      undid his cinch, behold! he was my friend. The same sweet smile was on his
      face that I had noted when I met him on my trip abroad. He knew me smiled
      faintly, made a few false motions and died. I begged that I might bear
      away the body to my tepee and express it to his country seat, near
      Limerick, and upon my bended knees, amid the dust and blood of the arena,
      I begged this pool favor, and a Roman prtor from St. George answered:
      "Let the carrion rot. There are no noble men but Romans and banana men.
      Let the show go on. Give us our money's worth. Bring out the bobtail lion
      from Abyssinia and the bucking bronco from Dead Man's Ranch." And the
      assembled maids and matrons and the rabble shouted in derision and told me
      to brace up, and bade Johnnie git his gun, git his gun, git his gun, and
      other vile flings which I do not now recall. And so must you, fellow
      warriors, and so must I, die like dogs. Ye stand here like giants (N. Y.
      Giants) as ye are, but to-morrow the fangs of the infuriated buffalo may
      sink into your quivering flesh. To-night ye stand here in the full flush
      of health and conscious rectitude, but to-morrow some crank may shoot you
      from the Deadwood coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark! Hear ye yon buffalo roaring in her den? 'Tis three days since she
      tasted flesh, but to-morrow she will have warrior on toast, and don't you
      forget it. And she will fling your vertebrae about her cage like the
      costly Etruscan pitcher of a League nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ye are brutes, then stand here like fat oxen waiting for the butcher's
      knife. If ye are men, arise and follow me. We will beat down the guard,
      overpower the ticket-chopper and cut for the tall timber. We will go
      through Ellum Park, Port Richmond, Tower Hill, West Brighton, Sailors'
      Snug Harbor and New Brighton like a colored revival through a watermelon
      patch, beat down the walls of the Circus Maximus, tear the mosquito bars
      from the windows of Nero's palace, capture the Roman ballet and light out
      for Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      O comrades! warriors!! gladiators!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      If we be men, let us die like men, beneath the blue sky, don't you know,
      and by the still waters, according to Gunter, in the presence of the
      nobility, rather than be stepped on by a spoiled bronco, surrounded by low
      tradesmen from New York.

    <h2>
      TO THE POOR SHINNECOCK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE can be
      nothing more pathetic than to watch the decay of a race, even though it be
      a scrub race. To watch the decay of the Indian race, has been with me, for
      many years a passion, and the more the Indian has decayed the more
      reckless I have been in studying his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian race for over two hundred years has been a race against Time,
      and I need hardly add that Time is away ahead as I pen these lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dislike to speak of myself so much, but I have been identified with the
      Indians more or less for fifteen years. In 1876 I was detailed by a San
      Francisco paper to attend the Custer massacre and write it up, but not
      knowing where the massacre was to be held I missed my way and wandered for
      days in an opposite direction. When I afterwards heard how successful the
      massacre was, and fully realized what I had missed, my mortification knew
      no bounds, but I might have been even more so if I had been successful. We
      never know what is best for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Indian is on the wane, whatever that is. He is disappearing from
      the face of the earth, and we find no better illustration of this sad fact
      than the gradual fading away of the Shinnecock Indians near the extremity
      of Long Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      In company with <i>The World</i> artist, who is paid a large salary to
      hold me up to ridicule in these columns, I went out the other day to
      Southampton and visited the surviving members of this great tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us knows the meaning of fear. If we had been ordered by the
      United States Government to wipe out the whole Shinnecock tribe we would
      have taken a damp towel and done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shinnecock tribe now consists of James Bunn and another man. But they
      are neither of them pure-blooded Shinnecock Indians. One-Legged Dave, an
      old whaler, who, as the gifted reader has no doubt already guessed, has
      but one leg, having lost the other in going over a reef many years ago, is
      a pure-blooded Indian, but not a pure-blooded Shinnecock. Most of these
      Indians are now mixed up with the negro race by marriage and are not
      considered warlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shinnecocks have not been rash enough to break out since they had the
      measles some years ago, but we will let that pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are now about 150 Shinnecocks on the reservation, the most of whom
      are negroes. They live together in peace and hominy, trying most of the
      time to ascertain what the wild waves are saying in regard to fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an air of gentle, all-pervading peace which hangs over the
      Shinnecock hills and that had its effect even upon my tumultuous and
      aggressive nature, wooing me to repose. I could rest there all this summer
      and then, after a good night's sleep, I could go right at it again in the
      morning. Rest at Southampton does not seem to fatigue one as it does
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shinnecock Indian has united his own repose of manner with the calm
      and haughty distrust of industry peculiar to the negro, and the result is
      something that approaches nearer to the idea of eternal rest than anything
      I have ever seen. The air seems to be saturated with it and the moonlight
      is soaked full of calm. It would be a good place in which to wander
      through the gloaming and pour a gallon or so of low, passionate yearning
      into the ear of a loved one.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a friend of mine, who is the teacher of modern languages and
      calisthenics in an educational institution, once said, "the air seems
      filled with that delicious dolce farina for which those regions is noted
      for." I use his language because I do not know now how I could add to it
      in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We visited Mr. James Bunn at his home on Huckleberry avenue, saw the City
      Hall and Custom House and obtained a front view of it, secured a picture
      of the residence of the Street Commissioner and then I talked with Mr.
      Bunn while the artist got a marine view of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bunn was for forty years a whaler, but had abandoned the habit now, as
      there is so little demand among the restaurants for whales, and also
      because there are fewer whales. I ascertained from him that the whale at
      this season of the year does not readily rise to the fly, but bites the
      harpoon greedily during the middle of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bunn also gave us a great deal of other Information, among other
      things informing us of the fact that the white men had been up to their
      old tricks and were trying to steal portions of the reservation that had
      not been nailed down. He did not say whether it was the same man who is
      trying to steal the old Southampton graveyard or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      James is about seventy-five years old and his father once lived in a
      wigwam on the Shinnecock Hills. Mr. Bunn says that the country has changed
      very much in the past 250 years and that I would hardly know the place if
      I could have seen it at first. During that time he says two other houses
      have been built and he has reshingled the L of his barn with hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told us the thrilling story of the Spanish Sylph and how she was
      wrecked many years ago on the coast near his house, and how the Spanish
      dollars burst out of her gaping side and fell with a low, mellow plunk
      into the raging main.
    </p>
    <p>
      How and then the sea has given up one of these "sand-dollars" as the years
      went by, and not over two years ago one was found along the shore near by.
      What I blame the Shinnecock Indians for is their fatal yearning to subsist
      solely on this precarious income.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the decline of the whaling industry, due somewhat to the great
      popularity of natural and acquired gas as a lubricant, together with the
      cheap methods of picking up electricity and preserving it for illuminating
      purposes, and also to the fact that whales are more skittish than they
      used to be, the Shinnecock whaler is left high and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, indeed, a pathetic picture. Here on the stern and rock-bound coast,
      where their ancestors greeted Columbus and other excursionists as they
      landed on the new dock and at once had their pictures taken in a group for
      the illustration on the greenbacks, now the surviving relic of a brave
      people, with bowed heads and frosting locks, are waiting a few days only
      for the long, dark night of merciful oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he walks in the night-time, all through the long fly time, he walks by
      the sorrowful sea, and he yearns to wake never, but lie there forever in
      the arms of the sheltering sea, to lie in the lap of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least that is my idea of the way the Shinnecock feels about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian race, wherever we find it, gives us a wonderful illustration of
      the great, inherent power of rum as a human leveler. The Indian has,
      perhaps, greater powers of endurance than the white man, and enters into
      the great unequal fight with rum almost hilariously, but he loses his
      presence of mind and forgets to call a cab at the proper moment. This is a
      matter that has never been fully understood even by the pale face, and of
      course the Indian is a perfect child in the great conflict with rum. The
      result is that the Indian is passing away under our very eyes, and the
      time will soon come when the Indian agent will have to seek some other
      healthful, outdoor exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the consumptive Shinnecock, the author of "Shinny on Your Own Ground
      and Other Games," is soon to live only in the flea-bitten records of a
      great nation. Once he wrote pieces for the boys to speak in school, and
      contributed largely to McGuffy's and Sander's periodicals, but now you
      never hear of an Indian who is a good extemporaneous public speaker, or
      who can write for sour apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      He no longer makes the statement that he is an aged hemlock, that his
      limbs are withered and his trunk attached by the constable. He has ceased
      to tell through the columns of the Fifth Reader how swift he used to be as
      a warrior and that the war-path is now overgrown with grass. He very
      seldom writes anything for the papers except over the signature of
      Veritas, and the able young stenographer who used to report his speeches
      at the council fire seems to have moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hundred and fifty years ago the Shinnecock Hills were covered by a
      dense forest, but in that brief period, as if by magic, two and one-half
      acres of that ground have been cleared, which is an average of an entire
      acre for every hundred years. When we stop to consider that very little of
      this work was done by the women and that the men have to attend to the
      cleaning of the whales in order to prepare them for the table, and also
      write their contributions for the school-books and sign treaties with the
      White Father at Washington, we are forced to admit that had the Indian's
      life been spared for a few thousand years more he would have been alive at
      the end of that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they wander on together, waiting for the final summons. Waiting for the
      pip or measles, and their cough is dry aud hacking as they cough along
      together towards the large and wide hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have lived so near Manhattan, where refinement is so plenty, where
      the joy they jerk from barley&mdash;every other day but Sunday&mdash;gives
      the town a reddish color, that the Shinnecock is dying, dying with his
      cowhide boots on, dying with his hectic flush on, while the church bells
      chime in Brooklyn and New Yorkers go to Jersey, go to get their
      fire-water, go to get their red-eyed bug-juice, go to get their cooking
      whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away at Minnehaha, in the land of the Dakota, where the cyclone feels
      so kinky, rising on its active hind-feet, with its tail up o'er the
      dash-board, blowing babies through the grindstone without injuring the
      babies, where the cyclone and the whopper journey on in joy together&mdash;there
      refinement and frumenti, with the new and automatic maladies and choice
      diseases that belong to the Caucasian, gather in the festive red man, take
      him to the reservation, rob him while his little life lasts, rob him till
      he turns his toes up, rob him till he kicks the bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Shinnecock is fading, he who greeted Chris. Columbus when he
      landed, tired and seasick, with a breath of peace and onions; he who
      welcomed other strangers, with their notions of refinement and their
      knowledge of the Scriptures and their fondness for Gambrinus&mdash;they
      have compassed his damnation and the Shinnecock is busted.

    <h2>
      WEBSTER AND HIS GREAT BOOK
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OAH Webster
      probably had the best command of language of any author of our time. Those
      who have read his great work entitled Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, or
      How One Word Led to Another, will agree with me that he was smart. Noah
      never lacked for a word by which to express himself. He was a brainy man
      and a good speller.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were speaking of Mr. Webster on the way up here this afternoon, and a
      gentleman from Ashland told me of his death. Those of you who have read
      Mr. Webster's works will be pained to learn of this. One by one our
      eminent men are passing away. Mr. Webster has passed away; Napoleon
      Bonaparte is no more, and Dr. Mary Walker is fading away. This has been a
      severe winter on Sitting Bull, and I have to guard against the night air a
      good deal myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would ill become me at this late date to criticise Mr. Webster's work,
      a work that is now I may say in nearly every office, home, school-room and
      counting-room in the land. It is a great book. I only hope that had Mr.
      Webster lived he would have been equally fair in his criticism of my
      books.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate to compare my books with Mr. Webster's, because it looks
      egotistical in me; but although Noah's book is larger than mine and has
      more literary attractions as a book to set a child on at the table, it
      does not hold the interest of the reader all the way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has tried to introduce too many characters into his book at the expense
      of the plot. It is a good book to pick up and while away a leisure hour,
      perhaps, but it is not a work that could rivet your interest till
      midnight, while the fire went out and the thermometer went down to 47
      below zero. You do not hurry through the pages to see whether Reginald
      married the girl or not. Mr. Webster didn't seem to care whether he
      married the girl or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therein consists the great difference between Noah and myself. He don't
      keep up the interest. A friend of mine at Sing Sing who secured one of my
      books, said he never left his room till he had devoured it. He said he
      seemed chained to the spot, and if you can't believe a convict who is
      entirely ont of politics, who in the name of George Washington can you
      believe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster was certainly a most brilliant writer, but a little inclined,
      perhaps, to be wrong. I have discovered in some of his later books 118,000
      words no two of which are alike. This shows great fluency and versatility,
      it is true, but we need something else. The reader waits in vain to be
      thrilled by the author's wonderful word-painting. There is not a thrill in
      the whole tome. Noah wasn't much of a thriller. I am free to confess that
      when I read this book, of which I had heard so much, I was bitterly
      disappointed. It is a larger book than mine and costs more, and has more
      pictures in it than mine, but is it a work that will make a man lead a
      different life? What does he say of the tariff? What does he say of the
      roller skating rink? He is silent. He is full of cold, hard words and dry
      definitions, but what does he say of the Mormons and female suffrage, and
      how to cure the pip? Nothing. He evades everything, just as a man does
      when he writes a letter accepting the nomination for President.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said before, however, it is a good book to pickup for a few moments
      or to read on the train. I could never think of taking a long r. r.
      journey without Mr. Webster's tale in my pocket. I would just as quick
      think of traveling without my bottle of cough medicine as to start out
      without Mr. Webster's book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Webster's Speller was a work of less pretensions, perhaps, but it had
      an immense sale. Eight years ago 40,000,000 of these books had been sold,
      and yet it had the same grave defect. It was disconnected, cold, prosy and
      dull. I read it for years, and at last became a very close student of Mr.
      Webster's style. Still I never found but one thing in the book for which
      there was such a stampede, which was even ordinarily interesting, and that
      was a perfect gem. It was so thrilling in detail and so different from Mr.
      Webster's general style that I have often wondered who he got to write it
      for him. Perhaps it was the author of the <i>Bread Winners</i>. It related
      to the discovery of a boy in the crotch of an old apple tree by an elderly
      gentleman, and the feeling of bitterness and animosity that sprang up
      between the two, and how the old man told the boy at first that he had
      better come down out of that tree, because he was afraid the limb would
      break with him and let him fall. Then, as the boy still remained, he told
      him that those were not eating-apples, that they were just common
      cooking-apples, and that there were worms in them. But the boy said he
      didn't mind a little thing like that. So then the old gentleman got
      irritated and called the dog and threw turf at the boy, and at last
      saluted him with pieces of turf and decayed cabbages; and after he had
      gone away the old man pried the bulldog's jaws open and found a mouthful
      of pantaloons and a freckle. I do not tell this, of course, in Mr.
      Webster's language but I give the main points as they recur now to my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though I have been a close student of Mr. Webster for years and examined
      his style closely, I am free to say that his ideas about writing a book
      are not the same as mine. Of course it is a great temptation for a young
      author to write a book that will have a large sale, but that should not be
      all. We should have a higher object than that, and strive to interest
      those who read our books. It should not be jerky and scattering in its
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not wish to do an injustice to a great man who I learn is now no
      more, a man who has done so much for the world and who could spell the
      longest word without hesitation, but I speak of these things just as I
      would expect others to criticise nay work. If one aspire to monkey with
      the <i>literati</i> of our day we must expect to be criticised. I have
      been criticised myself. When I was in public life&mdash;as a justice of
      the peace in the Rocky Mountains&mdash;a man came in one day and
      criticised me so that I did not get over it for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might add, though I dislike to speak of it now, that Mr. Webster was at
      one time a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts. I believe that was
      the only time he ever stepped aside from the straight and narrow way. A
      good many people do not know this, but it is true. It only shows how a
      good man may at one time in his life go wrong.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
